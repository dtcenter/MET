Foreword
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
This user's guide is provided as an aid to users of the Model Evaluation
 Tools - Tropical Cyclone (MET-TC).
 MET-TC is a set of tropical cyclone specific verification tools developed
 by the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) for use by the hurricane modeling
 community.
 This module is included in the MET v5.1 release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The first release of MET-TC (v4.1) was intended to replicate the functionality
 of the verification software developed at the National Hurricane Center
 (NHC).
 Additional capabilities have been added to incorporate user needs and advanceme
nts in TC verification.
 This software is primarily intended for operational purposes, but is also
 utilized for research purposes in the hurricane modeling community.
 The purpose of the MET-TC software is to replicate the functionally of
 the NHC verification system, with a modular design allowing additional
 capabilities and features to be added in future releases.
 The goal of this toolkit is to provide a standard set of verification metrics
 and comprehensive output statistics, which are available to all users to
 enable consistent forecast evaluation studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
MET-TC is an evolving module within the MET software package.
 The first version of MET-TC was released in May 2013 with MET v4.1.
 The second version of MET-TC was released in August 2014.
 The updates for MET-TC v5.1 primarily involve adding additional flags and
 added flexibility to each of the MET-TC modules to enhance user capabilities.
 Future releases are expected to include new capabilities and enhancements
 to the MET-TC tool.

Of the above common fields in the ATCF file format, MET-TC requires the
 input file has the first 17 comma-separated columns present.
 Although all 17 columns must exist, valid data in each field is not required.
 In order to ensure proper matching, unique data in the BASIN, CY, YYYYMMDDHH,
 and TAU fields should be present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The TC-Pairs tool expects two input data sources in order to generate matched
 pairs and subsequent error statistics.
 The expected input for MET-TC is an ATCF format file from model output,
 or the operational aids files with the operational model output for the
 'adeck' and the NHC best track analysis (BEST) for the 'bdeck'.
 The BEST is a subjectively smoothed representation of the storm's location
 and intensity over its lifetime.
 The track and intensity values are based on a retrospective assessment
 of all available observations of the storm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The BEST is in ATCF file format and contains all the above listed common
 fields.
 Given the reference dataset is expected in ATCF file format, any second
 ATCF format file from model output or operational model output from the
 NHC aids files can be supplied as well.
 The expected use of the TC-Pairs tool is to generate matched pairs between
 model output and the BEST.
 Note that some of the columns in the TC-Pairs output are populated based
 on the BEST information (e.g.
 storm category), therefore use of a different baseline many reduce the
 available filtering options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
All operational model aids and the BEST can be obtained from the NHC ftp

In order to adhere to ATCF file format, model data must be run through a
 vortex tracking algorithm prior to becoming input for MET-TC.
 Many vortex tracking algorithms have been developed in order to obtain
 basic position, maximum wind, and minimum sea level pressure information
 from a model forecasts.
 One vortex tracking algorithm that is supported and freely available is
 the GFDL vortex tracker.

\begin_layout Section
Output data format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The MET package produces output in four basic file formats: STAT files,
 ASCII files, NetCDF files, and Postscript plots.
 The MET-TC tool produces output in TCSTAT, which stands for Tropical Cyclone
 - STAT.
 This output format consists of tabular ASCII data that can be easily read
 by many analysis tools and software packages, making the output from MET-TC
 very versatile.
 Like STAT, TCSTAT is a specialized ASCII format containing one record on
 each line.
 Currently, the only line type available in MET-TC is TCMPR (Tropical Cyclone
 Matched Pairs).
 As more line types are included in future releases, all line types will
 be included in a single TCSTAT file.
 MET-TC also outputs a NetCDF format file in the TC-dland tool, as input
 to the TC-Pairs tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
TC-dland tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Many filtering criteria within the MET-TC tools depend on the distinction
 between when a storm is over land or water.
 The TC-dland tool was developed to aid in quickly parsing data for filter
 jobs that only verify over water, threshold verification based on distance
 to land, and exclusion of forecasts outside a specified time window of
 landfall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The TC-dland tool underwent a major overhaul for MET v5.1, switching from
 running legacy FORTRAN code over one quarter of the earth to computing
 more sophisticated great circle arc distances over the entire globe.
 The resulting distances are more accurate but take considerably longer
 to compute.
 Existing users of MET-TC may notice TC-dland running more slowly and slight
 differences in the computed distances compared with the previous version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
While the TC-dland tool is available to be run, most users will find the
 pre-computed distance to land files distributed with the release sufficient.
 Therefore, the typical user will not actually need to run this tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Input/output format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The input for the TC-dland tool is a file containing the longitude (degrees
 W negative) and latitude (degrees N positive) of all the coastlines and
 islands considered to be a significant landmass.
 The default input is to use all three land data files (aland.dat, shland.dat,
 wland.dat) found in the installed 
\series default
share/met/tc_data/
\series medium
 directory.
 The use of all three files produces a global land data file.
 The aland.dat file contains the longitude and latitude distinctions used
 by NHC for the Atlantic and eastern North Pacific basins, the shland.dat
 contains longitude and latitude distinctions for the Southern Hemisphere

The output file from TC-dland is a NetCDF format file containing a gridded
 field representing the distance to the nearest coastline or island, as
 specified in the input file.
 This file is used in the TC-Pairs tool to compute the distance from land
 for each track point in the adeck and bdeck.
 As noted in chapter 1.3, pre-computed distance to land (NetCDF output from

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The TC-Pairs tool provides position and intensity verification for tropical
 cyclone forecasts in ATCF file format.
 The TC-Pairs tool matches an ATCF format tropical cyclone (TC) forecast
 with a second ATCF format reference TC dataset (most commonly the Best
 Track analysis).
 The matched pairs produce position errors, as well as wind, sea level pressure,
 and distance to land values for each TC dataset.
 The pair generation can be subset based on user-defined filtering criteria.
 Practical aspects of the TC-Pairs tool are described in section 4.2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Practical information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
This section describes how to configure and run the TC-Pairs tool.
 The TC-Pairs tool is used to match a tropical cyclone model forecast to
 a corresponding reference dataset.
 Both tropical cyclone forecast/reference data must be in ATCF format.
 Output from the TC-dland tool (NetCDF gridded distance file) is also a
 required input for the TC-Pairs tool.
 It is recommended to run 
\emph on
tc_pairs
\emph default
 on a storm-by-storm basis, rather than over multiple storms or seasons
 to avoid memory issues.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adeck source
\series medium
: The 
\emph on
-adeck
\emph default
 argument indicates the ATCF format data source containing tropical cyclone
 model forecast (output from tracker) data to be verified.
 It specifies the name of an ATCF format file or top-level directory containing
 ATCF format files ending in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.dat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be processed.
 This source is expected to be the NHC Best Track Analysis, but could also
 be any ATCF format reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Config file

\begin_layout Standard
Optional arguments for tc_pairs
\series medium
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Out base:
\series medium
 The -out argument indicates the path of the output file base.
 This argument overrides the default output file base (./out_tcmpr)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Log file:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
V level:
\series medium
 The -v option indicates the desired level of verbosity.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will override the default setting of 2.
 Setting the verbosity to 0 will make the tool run with no log messages,
 while increasing the verbosity above 2 will increase the amount of log
 output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
An example of the tc_pairs calling sequence is shown below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
tc_pairs -adeck aal092010.dat -bdeck bal092010.dat -config TCPairsConfig
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
In this example, the TC-Pairs tool matches the model track (aal092010.dat)
 and the best track analysis (bal092010.dat) for the 9th Atlantic Basin storm
 in 2010.
 The track matching and subsequent error information is generated with configura
tion options specified in the 
\emph on
TCPairsConfig
\emph default
 file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The TC-Pairs tool implements the following logic:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
* Parse the adeck and bdeck data files and store them as track objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
* Apply configuration file settings to filter the adeck and bdeck track
 data down to a subset of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
* Apply configuration file settings to derive additional adeck track data,
 such as interpolated tracks, consensus tracks, time-lagged tracks, and
 statistical track and intensity models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
* For each adeck track that was parsed or derived, search for a matching
 bdeck track with the same basin and cyclone number and overlapping valid
 times.
 If not matching against the BEST track, also ensure that the model initializati
on times match.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
* For each adeck/bdeck track pair, match up their track points in time,
 lookup distances to land, compute track location errors, and write an output
 TCMPR line for each track point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
TC_Pairs configuration file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The default configuration file for the TC-Pairs tool named 'TCPairsConfig_defaul

 The 
\series default
file_name
\series medium

\series medium
 directory within the MET build.
 The 
\series default
time_offset
\series medium
 string is the time window (in seconds) assigned to the watch/warning.
 Due to the non-uniform time watches and warnings are issued, a time window
 is assigned for which watch/warnings are included in the verification for
 each valid time.
 The default watch/warn file is static, and therefore may not include warned
 storms beyond the current MET code release date; therefore users may wish
 to contact met_help@ucar.edu to obtain the most recent watch/warning file
 if the static file does not contain storms of interest.

\begin_layout Chapter
TC-Stat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The TC-Stat tool ties together results from the TC-Pairs tool by providing
 summary statistics and filtering jobs on TCST output files.
 The TC-Stat tool requires TCST output from the TC-Pairs tool.
 See section 4.2.3 of this users guide for information on the TCST output
 format of the TC-Pairs tool.
 A filtering job using TC-Stat provides the ability to filter the input
 data by various conditions and thresholds described in section 5.3.2.
 A summary job produces summary statistics including frequency of superior
 performance, time-series independence calculations, and confidence intervals
 on the mean.
 These statistical aspects are described in section 5.2, and practical use
 information for the TC-Stat tool is described in section 5.3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Statistical aspects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Filter TCST lines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The TC-Stat tool can be used to simply filter specific lines of the TCST
 file based on user-defined filtering criteria.
 All of the TCST lines that are retained from one or more files are written
 out to a single output file.
 The output file is also in TCST format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Filtering options are outlined below in section 5.3.2 (configuration file).
 Additional filtering options that can be executed on the command line will
 give the minimum, maximum, or exact value for a particular column: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
-column_min
\series medium
 arguments: column_name value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
-column_max
\series medium
 arguments: column_name value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
-column_eq
\series medium
 arguments: column_name value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
-column_str 
\series medium
arguments: column_name string
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
If multiple options are listed, the job will be performed on their intersection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Summary statistics for columns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The TC-Stat tool can be used to produce summary information for a single
 column of data.
 After the user specifies the specific column of interest, and any other
 relevant search criteria, summary information is produced from values in
 that column of data.
 The summary statistics produced are: mean, standard deviation, minimum,
 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, and maximum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Confidence intervals are computed for the mean of the column of data.
 Confidence intervals are computed using the assumption of normality for
 the mean.
 For further information on computing confidence intervals, refer to Appendix
 D of the MET user's guide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
When operating on columns, a specific column name can be listed (e.g.
 TK_ERR), as well as the differences of two columns (e.g.
 AMAX_WIND-BMAX_WIND), and the absolute difference of the column(s) (e.g.
 abs(AMAX_WIND-BMAX_WIND)).
 Additionally, several shortcuts can be applied to choose multiple columns
 with a single entry.
 Shortcut options for the -column entry are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
TRACK:
\series medium
 track error (TK_ERR), along-track error (ALTK_ERR), and cross-track error
 (CRTK_ERR)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
WIND:
\series medium
 all wind radii errors (34-, 50-, and 64-kt) for each quadrant
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
TI:
\series medium
 track error (TK_ERR) and absolute intensity error (abs(AMAX_WIND-BMAX_WIND))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
AC:
\series medium
 along- and cross-track errors (ALTK_ERR, CRTK_ERR)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
XY: 
\series medium
X- and Y-component track errors (X_ERR, Y_ERR)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The TC-Stat tool can also be used to generate frequency of superior performance
 and the time to independence calculations when using the TC-Stat summary
 job.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Frequency of Superior Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The frequency of superior performance (FSP) looks at multiple model forecasts
 (adecks), and ranks each model relative to other model performance for
 the column specified in the summary job.
 The summary job output lists the total number of cases included in the
 FSP, the number of cases where the model of interest is the best (e.g.: lowest
 track error), the number of ties between the models, and the FSP (percent).
 Ties are not included in the FSP percentage; therefore the percentage may
 not equal 100%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Time-Series Independence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The time-series independence evaluates effective forecast separation time
 using the Siegel method, by comparing the number of runs above and below
 the mean error to an expected value.
 This calculation expects the columns in the summary job to be a time series.
 The output includes the forecast hour interval and the number of hours
 to independence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Practical information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The following sections describe the usage statement, required arguments,
 and optional arguments for tc_stat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
tc_stat usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The usage statement for tc_stat is shown below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Usage: -lookin source
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
[-out file]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
[-log file]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
[-v level]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
[-config file] | [JOB COMMAND LINE]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
TC-Stat has one required argument and accepts optional ones.
 The usage statement for the TC-Stat tool includes the "job" term, which
 refers to the set of tasks to be performed after applying user-specified
 filtering options.
 The filtering options are used to pare down the TC-Pairs output to only
 those lines that are desired for the analysis.
 The job and its filters together comprise a "job command line".
 The "job command line" may be specified either on the command line to run
 a single analysis job or within the configuration file to run multiple
 analysis jobs at the same time.
 If jobs are specified in both the configuration file and the command line,
 only the jobs indicated in the configuration file will be run.
 The various jobs are described in Table 5-1 and the filtering options are
 described in section 5.3.2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Required arguments for tc_stat:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lookin source:
\series medium
 The 
\emph on
-lookin
\emph default
 argument indicates the location of the input TCST files generated from
 
\emph on
tc_pairs
\emph default
.
 This argument can be used one or more times to specify the name of a TCST
 file or top-level directory containing TCST files to be processed.
 Multiple tcst files may be specified by using a wild card (*).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optional arguments for tc_stat:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Out file:
\series medium
 The 
\emph on
-out
\emph default
 argument indicates the desired name of the TCST format output file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Log file:
\series medium
 The -
\emph on
log
\emph default
 argument indicates the name of the log file associated with tc_stat output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
V level:
\series medium
 The 
\emph on
-v 
\emph default
option indicates the desired level of verbosity.
 The value of "level" will override the default setting of 2.
 Setting the verbosity to 0 will make the tool run with no log messages,
 while increasing the verbosity above 2 will increase the amount of log
 output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Config file:
\series medium
 The 
\emph on
-config
\emph default
 argument indicates the name of the configuration file to be used.
 The contents of the configuration file are discussed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
An example of the 
\emph on
tc_stat 
\emph default
calling sequence is shown below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
tc_stat -lookin /home/tc_pairs/*al092010.tcst -config TCStatConfig
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
In this example, the TC-Stat tool uses any TCST file (output from 
\emph on
tc_pairs
\emph default
) in the listed directory for the 9th Atlantic Basin storm in 2010.
 Filtering options and aggregated statistics are generated following configurati
on options specified in the 
\emph on
TCStatConfig
\emph default
 file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
tc_stat configuration file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The default configuration file for the 
\emph on
TC-Stat
\emph default
 tool named 
\emph on
TCStatConfig_default
\emph default
 can be found in the installed 
\series default
share/met/config
\series medium
 directory.
 Like the other configuration files described in this document, it is recommende
d that users make a copy of these files prior to modifying their contents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Most of the user-specified options listed in the TC-Stat configuration file
 are used to filter the TCST output from 
\emph on
tc_pairs
\emph default
 down to the desired subset over which the statistics will be computed.
 Only output from the TC-Pairs tool that meet the filtering criteria listed
 in the TC-Stat configuration file will be retained.
 A detailed description of the TC-Stat configuration file is listed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Note that the options specified in the first section of the configuration
 file, prior to the job list, will be applied to every job specified in
 the joblist.
 However, if an individual job specifies an option listed above, it will
 be applied to that job.
 For example, if model = [
\emph on
"GFSI","LGEM","DSHP"
\emph default
] is set at the top, but the job in the joblist sets the -model option to
 
\emph on
"LGEM"
\emph default
, that job will only run using the LGEM model data.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Graphical capabilities are included in the MET-TC release in order to assist
 users with a set of standard plotting capabilities.
 The basic R script is located in the MET build in 
\series default
scripts/Rscripts/plot_tcmpr.R
\series medium
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
plot_tcmpr.R usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The usage statement with a short description of the options for 
\emph on
plot_tcmpr.R
\emph default
 can be obtained by typing: Rscript 
\emph on
plot_tcmpr.R
\emph default
 with no additional arguments.
 The only required argument is the 
\emph on
-lookin
\emph default
 source, which is the path to the TC-Pairs TCST output files.
 The R script reads directly from the TC-Pairs output, and calls TC-Stat
 directly for filter jobs specified in the "
\emph on
-filter options
\emph default
" argument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
In order to run this script, the 
\series default
MET_BUILD_DIR
\series medium
 environment variable must be set to the top-level MET build directory.
 In addition, the 
\emph on
tc_stat tool
\emph default
 must be in your path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The supplied R script can generate a number of different plot types including
 boxplots, mean, median, rank, and relative performance.
 Pairwise differences can be plotted for the boxplots, mean, and median.
 Normal confidence intervals are applied to all figures unless the no_ci
 option is set to TRUE.
 Below are two example plots generated from the tools.
