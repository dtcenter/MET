MODE Time Domain (MTD) is an extension of the MODE object-based approach
 to verification.
 In addition to incorporating spatial information, MTD utilizes the time
 dimension to get at temporal aspects of forecast verification.
 Since the two spatial dimensions of traditional meteorological forecasts
 are retained in addition to the time dimension, the method in inherently
 three dimensional.
 Given that, however, the overall methodology has deliberately been kept
 as similar as possible to that of traditional MODE.

A plot of some MTD precipitation objects is shown over the United States
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "MTD_3d_color_fig"

\end_inset

.
 The colors indicate longitude, with red in the east moving through the
 spectrum to blue in the west.
 Time increases vertically in this plot (and in most of the spacetime diagrams
 in this users' guide).
 A few things are worthy of note in this figure.
 First, the tendency of storm systems to move from west to east over time
 shows up clearly.
 Second, tracking of storm objects over time is easily done: if we want
 to know if a storm at one time is a later version of a storm at an earlier
 time, we need only see if they are part of the same 3D spacetime object.
 Lastly, storms splitting up or merging over time are handled easily by
 this method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 2D (or traditional) MODE approach to object-base verification enabled
 users to analyze forecasts in terms of location errors, intensity errors
 and shape, size and orientation errors.
 MTD retains all of that capability, and adds new classes of forecast errors
 involving time information: speed and direction errors, buildup and decay
 errors, and timing and duration errors.
 This opens up new ways of analyzing forecast quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
In the past, many MET users have performed separate MODE runs at a series
 of forecast valid times and analyzed the resulting object attributes, matches
 and merges as functions of time in an effort to incorporate temporal informatio
n in assessments of forecast quality.
 MTD was developed as a way to address this need in a more systematic way.
 Most of the information obtained from such multiple coordinated MODE runs
 can be obtained more simply from MTD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
At first glance, the addition of a third dimension would seem to entail
 no difficulties other than increased memory and processing requirements
 to handle the three-dimensional datasets and objects, and that would indeed
 be largely true of an extension of MODE that used three spatial dimensions.
 In fact, the implementation of MTD entailed both conceptual difficulties
 (mostly due to the fact that there is no distance function in spacetime,
 so some MODE attributes, such as centroid distance, no longer even made
 sense), and engineering difficulties brought on by the need to redesign
 several core MODE algorithms for speed.
 It is planned that in the future some of these improved algorithms will
 be incorporated into MODE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
In this users' guide, we will assume that the reader has a basic familiarity
 with traditional MODE, its internal operation, (convolution thresholding,
 fuzzy logic matching and merging) and its output.
 We will not review these things here.
 Instead, we will point out differences in MTD from the way traditional
 MODE does things when they come up.
 This release is a beta version of MTD, intended mostly to encourage users
 to experiment with it and give us feedback and suggestions to be used in
 a more robust MTD release in the future.

Attributes
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "subsec:_MTD_Attributes"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Object attributes are, for the most part, calculated in much the same way
 in MTD as they are in MODE, although the fact that one of the dimensions
 is non-spatial introduces a few quirks.
 Several of the object attributes that traditional MODE calculates assume
 that distances, angles and areas can be calculated in grid coordinates
 via the usual Euclidian/Cartesian methods.
 That is no longer the case in spacetime, since there is no distance function
 (more precisely, no 
\emph on
metric
\emph default
) there.
 Given two points in this spacetime, say 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$(x_1, y_1, t_1)$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$(x_2, y_2, t_2)$
\end_layout

\end_inset

, there is no way to measure their separation with a single nonnegative
 number in a physically meaningful way.
 If all three of our dimensions were spatial, there would be no difficulties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
This means that some care must be taken both in determining how to generalize
 the calculation of a geometric attribute to three-dimensional spacetime,
 and also in interpreting the attributes even in the case where the generalizati
on is straightforward.

\begin_layout Subsection
Convolution
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:MTD_Convolution"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
As in MODE, MTD applies a convolution filter to the raw data as a preliminary
 step in resolving the field into objects.
 The convolution step in MTD differs in several respects from that performed
 in MODE, however.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
First, MTD typically reads in several planes of data for each data field—one
 plane for each time step, and there is really no limit to the number of
 time steps.
 So MTD is convolving much more data than it would be if it were simply
 analyzing a 2D data field.
 Secondly, MTD convolves in time as well as space, which again increases
 the amount of data needing to be processed.
 The net effect of all this is to greatly increase the time needed to perform
 the convolution step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Because of this, the developers decided to make several changes in the way
 convolution was performed in MTD.
 Most of the differences come from the need to make the convolution step
 as fast as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The most basic change is to use a square convolution filter rather than
 the circular one that MODE uses.
 The overall 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

size
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the filter is still determined by one parameter (denoted 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$R$
\end_layout

\end_inset

, as in MODE), but this should not be thought of as a 
\emph on
radius
\emph default
.
 Instead, the size of the square is 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$(2 R + 1) 
\backslash
times (2 R + 1)$
\end_layout

\end_inset

, as shown in Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Another change is that we do not allow any bad data in thee convolution
 square.
 in MODE, the user may specify what percentage of bad data in the convolution
 region is permissible, and MODE will rescale the value of the filter accordingl
y for each data point.
 For the sake of speed, MTD requires that there be no bad data in the convolutio
n region.
 If any bad data exists in the region, the convolved value there is set
 to a bad data flag.

\begin_inset ERT

$(v_x, v_y)$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is obtained by fitting a line to an 3D object.
 The requirement for fitting the line is to minimize the sum of the squares
 of the 
\emph on
spatial
\emph default
 distances from each point of the object to the line be minimized.
 (We can't measure distances in spacetime but at each fixed time 
\emph on
t
\emph default
 we can measure purely spatial distances.) See Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "MTD_velocity"

\end_inset

 for an illustration, where the solid line is the fitted axis, and the inclinati
on of the axis from the vertical is a measure of object speed.
 Thus, from this velocity we get the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
bf direction}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 of movement of the object.
 As in MODE, where spatial separation is in units of the grid resolution,
 so here in MTD the unit of length is the grid resolution, and the unit
 of time is whatever the time separation between the input files is.
 Speed and velocity are thus in grid units per time unit.

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The spatial orientation of a object (what traditional MODE calls the 
\series bold
axis angle
\series medium
 of an object) is gotten by fitting a plane to an object.
 As with the case of velocity, our optimization criterion is that the sum
 of the squares of the spatial distances from each point of the object to
 the plane be minimized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "MTD_axis_3d"

\end_inset

 gives some idea of the reason for fitting a plane, rather than a line,
 as MODE does.
 On the left in the figure, we see an object (in blue shaped like an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) at several time steps moving through the grid.
 For simplicity, the object is not rotating as it moves (though of course
 real objects can certainly do this).
 At each time step, the 2D MODE spatial axis of the object is indicated
 by the red line.
 In the center of the figure, we see the same thing, just with more time
 steps.
 And on the right, even more time steps.
 We see that the axis lines at each time step sweep out a plane in three
 dimensions, shown in red on the right.
 This plane is the same one that MTD would calculate for this 3D object
 to determine its spatial orientation, 
\series default
\shape italic
i.e.
\series medium
\shape default
, axis angle.
 Indeed, for the special case of an object that is not moving at all, the
 MTD calculation of axis angle reduces to the same one that traditional
 MODE uses, as it should.

The final category of object attributes calculated by MTD are two-dimensional
 spatial attributes for horizontal (

 These 2D constant-time attributes are written out for both simple and cluster

For example, in our earlier discussion relating to Figure

 to rotate as it moved.
 But what if the object (a hurricane, for example)

 a single spatial orientation to the object over its entire lifetime.
 If we had a spatial axis angle at each time, however, then we could fit

Matching and merging operations in MTD are done in a simpler fashion than
 in MODE.
 In order to understand this operation, it is necessary to discuss some
 very basic notions of graph theory.

A

\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

, with each edge connecting two vertices.
 Conceptually, it is enough for our purposes to think of vertices as points
 and edges as lines connecting them.
 See Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 for an illustration.
 In the figure we see a collection of 11 nodes, indicated by the small circles,
 together with some edges indicated by straight line segments.
 A 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_inset ERT

 such that for each 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 there is an edge connecting

\end_layout

\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 For example, in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "MTD_basic_graph"

, there is no edge connecting vertices #6 and #7, but there is a path connecting
 them.
 In illustrations, graph vertices are often labelled with identifying informatio
n, such as the numbers in Figure

If we consider two distinct nodes in a graph to be related if there is a
 path connecting them, then it's easy to see that this defines an equivalence
 relation on the set of nodes, partitioning the graph into equivalence classes.
 Any node, such as #10 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, that has no edges emanating from it is in a class by itself.

\begin_layout Standard

We have barely scratched the surface of the enormous subject of graph theory,
 but this will suffice for our purposes.
 How does MTD use graphs? Essentially the simple forecast and observed objects
 become nodes in a graph.
 Each pair of objects that have sufficiently high total interest (as determined
 by the fuzzy logic engine) generates an edge connecting the two corresponding
 nodes in the graph.
 The graph is then partitioned into equivalence classes using path connectivity
 (as explained above), and the resulting equivalence classes determine the
 matches and merges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
An example will hopefully make this clear.
 In parts (a) and (b) of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "MTD_2d_example"

\end_inset

 we indicate the objects in the forecast and observed field for this simple
 example.
 We have used 2D rather than 3D objects in this example for simplicity.
 Also, to help distinguish the objects in each field, the forecast objects
 are labelled by numbers and the observed object by letters.
 Each forecast and each observed object become nodes in a graph as indicated
 in part (c) of the figure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For the purposes of this example, suppose that the MTD fuzzy engine reports
 that observed simple object B and forecast simple object 4 together have
 a total interest higher than the total interest threshold specified in
 the config file.
 Also, observed simple object C and forecast simple object 4 have high enough
 interest to pass the threshold.
 Furthermore, forecast simple objects 2 and 3 both have sufficiently high
 interest when paired with observed simple object A.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
These four pairings result in the 4 edges in the graph shown by the solid
 lines in part (c) of the figure.
 Partitioning this graph into equivalence classes results in the three sets
 indicated in part (d) of the figure.
 These three sets are the cluster objects determined by MTD.
 In this example, forecast objects 2 and 3 are merged into forecast cluster
 object #1 which is matched to observed cluster object #1, consisting of
 observed object A.
 (As in MODE, a cluster object may contain multiple simple objects, but
 may also consist of a single simple object.) Essentially, forecast simple
 objects 2 and 3 are merged because there is a path connecting them in the
 graph.
 This is indicated by the dashed line in the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Continuing this example, forecast cluster object #2 (consisting only of
 forecast simple object 4) is matched to observed cluster object #2 (consisting
 of observed simple objects B and C).
 Again, the merging of observed simple objects is indicated by the dashed
 line in the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Forecast cluster object #3 consists solely of forecast simple object 1.
 It is not matched to any observed cluster object.
 Alternatively, one may take the viewpoint that forecast simple object 1
 ended up not participating in the matching and merging process; it is not
 merged with anything, it is not matched with anything.
 Essentially it represents a false alarm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
To summarize: Any forecast simple objects that find themselves in the same
 equivalence class are merged.
 Similarly, any observed objects in the same class are merged.
 Any forecast and observed objects in the same class are matched.

\begin_layout Standard
The formats for two-dimensional data files used as input to MTD are the
 same ones supported by most of the MET tools.
 Generally speaking, if MODE can use a forecast or observation data file
 as input, then that file can also be used by MTD.
 The only difference is that while MODE takes only one forecast and one
 observed data file as input, MTD takes a series of files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in the next section, filenames for each time used must be given.
 Thus, for example, if MTD is being used for verification over a period
 of 24 hours, and the data file valid times are separated by one hour, then
 a total of 48 filenames must be specified on the MTD command line — 24
 filenames for the forecast files, and 24 for the observation files.
 Further, the filenames must be given in order of increasing valid time.
 Many users will prefer to write scripts to automate this, rather than type
 in a lengthy command line by hand.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MTD creates several output files after each run in ASCII and NetCDF formats.
 There are text files giving 2D and 3D attributes of spacetime objects and
 information on matches and merges, as well as a NetCDF file giving the
 objects themselves, in case any further or specialized analysis of the
 objects needs to be done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MODE, along with several other of the MET tools (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
tt wavelet
\backslash
_stat}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for example, and a few others), provides PostScript-based graphics output
 to help visualize the output.
 Unfortunately, no similar graphics capabilities are provided with MTD,
 mainly because of the complexity of producing 3D plots.
 This should not discourage the user from making their own plots, however.
 There is enough information in the various output files created by MTD
 to make a wide variety of plots.
 Highly motivated users who write their own plotting scripts are encouraged
 to submit them to the user-contributed code area of the MET website.
 Due credit will be given, and others will benefit from their creations.

\begin_layout Standard
Five ASCII output files are created:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Single attributes for 3D simple objects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Single attributes for 3D cluster objects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pair attributes for 3D simple objects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pair attributes for 3D cluster objects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
2D spatial attributes for single simple objects for each time index of their
 existence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each ASCII file is laid out in tabular format, with the first line consisting
 of text strings giving names for each column.
 The first 15 columns of each file are identical, and give information on
 timestamps, model names, and the convolution radius and threshold used
 for the forecast and observation input data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These columns are explained in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table_mtd-header-columns"

\end_inset

.
 Each file contains additional columns that come after these.
 Columns for 2D constant-time attributes are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table_mtd-2D-Attributes"

\end_inset

.
 Columns for 3D single and pair attributes are shown in Tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table_mtd-3D-single-attributes"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table_mtd-3D-Pair-Attribute"

\end_inset

 respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contents of the OBJECT_ID and OBJECT_CAT columns identify the objects
 using the same logic as the MODE tool.
 In these columns, the F and O prefixes are used to indicate simple forecast
 and observation objects, respectively.
 Similarly, the CF and CO prefixes indicate cluster forecast and observation
 objects, respectively.
 Each prefix is followed by a 3-digit number, using leading zeros, to indicate
 the object number (as in 
\family typewriter
F001
\family default
,
\family typewriter
 O001
\family default
,
\family typewriter
 CF001
\family default
, or
\family typewriter
 CO000
\family default
).
 Pairs of objects are indicated by listing the forecast object information
 followed by the observation object information, separated by an underscore
 (as in 
\family typewriter
F001_O001
\family default
 or
\family typewriter
 CF001_CO001
\family default
).
 The OBJECT_ID column indicates the single object or pair of objects being
 described in that line.
 The OBJECT_CAT column indicates the cluster or pair of clusters to which
 these object(s) belong.
 A simple object that is not part of a cluster is assigned a cluster number
 of zero (as in 
\family typewriter
CF000
\family default
 or
\family typewriter
 CO000
\family default
).
 When pairs of objects belong to the same matching cluster, the OBJECT_CAT
 column indicates the matching cluster number (as in 
\family typewriter
CF001_CO001
\family default
).
 When they do not, the OBJECT_CAT column is set to 
\family typewriter
CF000_CO000
\family default
.

NetCDF File

\begin_layout Standard
MTD writes a NetCDF file containing various types of information as specified
 in the configuration file.
 The possible output data are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
bf Latitude}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
bf longitude}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 of all the points in the 2D grid.
 Useful for geolocating points or regions given by grid coordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
bf Raw data}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 from the input data files.
 This can be useful if the input data were grib format, since NetCDF is
 often easier to read.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
bf Object ID}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 numbers, giving for each grid point the number of the simple object (if
 any) that covers that point.
 These numbers are one-based.
 A value of zero means that this point is not part of any object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{

 As above, only for cluster objects rather than simple objects.
