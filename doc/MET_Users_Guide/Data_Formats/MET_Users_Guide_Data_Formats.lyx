\begin_layout Chapter
MET Data I/O, Re-Formatting, and Checking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Data must be preprocessed prior to using for verification.
 Several MET tools exist for this purpose.
 In addition to preprocessing observations, some plotting utilities for
 data checking are also provided and described at the end of this chapter.
 Both the input and output file formats are described in this chapter.
 Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are primarily concerned with re-formatting input files
 into the intermediate files required by some MET modules.
 These steps are represented by the first three columns in the MET flowchart
 depicted in Fig.
 1-1.
 Output data formats and the software modules used to reformat the data
 are described in later sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Input data formats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The MET package can handle gridded input data in one of three formats: GRIB
 version 1, GRIB version 2, or netCDF classic format.
 Point observation files may be supplied in either PrepBufr, ASCII, or MADIS
 format.
 Note that MET does not require the Unified Post-Processor to be used, but
 does require that the input GRIB data be on a standard, de-staggered grid
 on pressure or regular levels in the vertical.
 While the Grid-Stat, Wavelet-Stat, and MODE tools can be run on a gridded
 field at virtually any level, the Point-Stat tool can only be used to verify
 forecasts at the surface or on pressure levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
When comparing two gridded fields with the Grid-Stat, Wavelet-Stat, or MODE
 tools, the input model and observation datasets must have already been
 placed on the same grid.
 The copygb utility is recommended for re-gridding GRIB files.
 To preserve characteristics of the observations, it is generally preferred
 to re-grid the model data to the observation grid, rather than vice versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Input point observation files in PrepBufr format are available through NCEP.
 The PrepBufr observation files contain a wide variety of point-based observatio
n types in a single file in a standard format.
 However, some users may wish to use observations not included in the standard
 PrepBufr files.
 For this reason, prior to performing the verification step in the Point-Stat
 tool, the PrepBufr file is reformatted with the PB2NC tool.
 In this step, the user can select various ways of stratifying the observation
 data spatially, temporally, and by type.
 The remaining observations are reformatted into an intermediate NetCDF
 file.
 The ASCII2NC tool may be used to convert ASCII point observations that
 are not available in the PrepBufr files into this NetCDF format for use
 by the Point-Stat verification tool.
 Users with METAR or RAOB data from MADIS can convert these observations
 into NetCDF format with the MADIS2NC tool, then use them with the Point-Stat
 verification tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Intermediate data formats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
MET uses NetCDF as an intermediate file format.
 The Ensemble-Tool, WWMCA-Tool, Pcp-Combine, Gen-Poly-Mask, Gen-Circle-Mask,
 PB2NC, MADIS2NC, and ASCII2NC tools write intermediate files in NetCDF
 format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The Pcp-Combine tool operates in 3 different modes.
 It may be used to 
\series default
sum
\series medium
 accumulated precipitation from several GRIB files into a single NetCDF
 file containing the desired accumulation period.
 It may also be used to 
\series default
add
\series medium
 or 
\series default
subtract
\series medium
 the accumulated precipitation in two gridded data files directly.
 The command line arguments for the Pcp-Combine tool vary depending on the
 mode in which it is run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The user may choose to: (1) combine the model accumulations to match the
 observation accumulation period, (2) combine the observation accumulations
 to match the model accumulation period, or (3) combine both the model and
 observation accumulations to some new period desired for verification.
 In performing this summation, the user may not specify an accumulation
 interval smaller than the accumulation period in the input files.
 However, if the input model and observation files already contain accumulated
 precipitation with the same desired accumulation period, then 
\emph on
pcp_combine
\emph default
 need not be run.
 Each time the Pcp-Combine tool is called, a NetCDF file is written containing
 the requested accumulation period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The 
\emph on
Gen-Poly-Mask
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Gen-Circle_Mask
\emph default
 tools are used to define a bitmapped masking region that can be used by
 the statistics tools as a verification subdomain.
 It is generally more efficient to use the NetCDF output of these tools
 to define a masking region than using a complex polyline directly in the
 other MET tools.
 However, the NetCDF output can only be applied to datasets on a common
 domain.
 It must be regenerated for each domain used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The PB2NC tool is used to reformat the input PrepBufr files containing point
 observations.
 This tool stratifies the observations as requested in a configuration file
 and writes out the remaining observations in a NetCDF format.
 The NetCDF output of the PB2NC tool is used as input to the verification
 step performed in the Point-Stat tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The ASCII2NC tool simply reformats ASCII point observations into the NetCDF
 format needed by the Point-Stat tool.
 The output NetCDF file from the ASCII2NC tool has a format that is identical
 to the format of the output from the PB2NC tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Output data formats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The MET package currently produces output in four basic file formats: STAT
 files, ASCII files, NetCDF files, PostScript plots, and png plots from
 the Plot-Mode-Field utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The STAT format consists of tabular ASCII data that can be easily read by
 many analysis tools and software packages.
 MET produces STAT output for the Grid-Stat, Point-Stat, and Wavelet-Stat
 tools.
 STAT is a specialized ASCII format containing one record on each line.
 However, a single STAT file may contain multiple line types.
 Several header columns at the beginning of each line remain the same for
 each line type.
 However, the remaining columns after the header change for each line type.
 STAT files can be difficult for a human to read as the quantities represented
 for many columns of data change from line to line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
For this reason, ASCII output is also available as an alternative for the
 Grid-Stat, Point-Stat, and Wavelet-Stat tools.
 The ASCII files contain exactly the same output as the STAT files but each
 STAT line type is grouped into a single ASCII file with a column header
 row making the output more human-readable.
 The configuration files control which line types are output and whether
 or not the optional ASCII files are generated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The MODE tool creates two ASCII output files as well (although they are
 not in a STAT format).
 It generates an ASCII file containing contingency table counts and statistics
 comparing the model and observation fields being compared.
 The MODE tool also generates a second ASCII file containing all of the
 attributes for the single objects and pairs of objects.
 Each line in this file contains the same number of columns, and those columns
 not applicable to a given line type contain fill data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The Ensemble-Stat, Grid-Stat, Wavelet-Stat, Series-Analysis, and MODE tools
 generate gridded NetCDF output.
 The MODE tool creates a NetCDF file containing four gridded fields for
 the objects identified in the forecast and observation, simple and cluster
 object fields.
 The Ensemble-Stat creates a NetCDF file containing the ensemble forecast
 values, statistics, and, if requested, matched observations for each verificati
on region and variable type/level requested in the configuration file.
 In addition, when rank histogram information is requested, the NetCDF file
 contains the observation rank values.
 The Grid-Stat tool creates a NetCDF file containing the matched forecast/observ
ation pairs and the forecast minus observation difference fields for each
 verification region and variable type/level requested in the configuration
 file.
 The Wavelet-Stat tool creates a NetCDF file summarizing the wavelet decompositi
on of the forecast and observation fields for each variable type/level,
 raw threshold, and tile masking region chosen.
 The generation of these files is controlled by configuration files or command
 line switches.
 As discussed in the previous section, the Pcp-Combine, Gen-Poly-Mask, and
 Gen-Circle-Mask tools create gridded NetCDF output as well, while the PB2NC,
 MADIS2NC, and ASCII2NC tools create intermediate NetCDF files containing
 point observations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The MODE and Wavelet-Stat tools produce PostScript plots summarizing the
 features-based approach used in the verification.
 The PostScript plots are generated using internal libraries and do not
 depend on an external plotting package.
 The MODE plots contain several summary pages at the beginning, but the
 total number of pages will depend on the merging options chosen.
 Additional pages will be created if merging is performed using the double
 thresholding or fuzzy engine merging techniques for the forecast and observatio
n fields.
 The number of pages in the Wavelet-Stat plots depend on the number of masking
 tiles used and the dimension of those tiles.
 The first summary page is followed by plots for the wavelet decomposition
 of the forecast and observation fields.
 The generation of these PostScript output files can be disabled using command
 line options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Users can use the optional plotting utilities Plot-Data-Plane, Plot-Point-Obs,
 and Plot-Mode-Field to produce graphics showing forecast, observation,
 and MODE object files.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Data format summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The following is a summary of the input and output formats for each of the
 tools currently in MET.
 The output listed is the maximum number of possible output files.
 Generally, the type of output files generated can be controlled by the
 configuration files and/or the command line options:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
This section describes how to run the ASCII2NC tool.
 The ASCII2NC tool is used to reformat ASCII point observations into the
 NetCDF format expected by the Point-Stat tool.
 For those users wishing to verify against point observations that are not
 available in PrepBufr format, the ASCII2NC tool provides a way of incorporating
 those observations into MET.
 If the ASCII2NC tool is used to perform a reformatting step, no configuration
 file is needed.
 However, for more complex processing, such as summarizing time series observati
ons, a configuration file may be specified.
 For details on the configuration file options, see the README and example
 configuration files distributed with the MET code.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The initial version of the ASCII2NC tool supports input ASCII point observation
 format consisting of 11 columns of data for each observation value.
 The ASCII2NC tool was enhanced for version 4.1 of MET to handle data in
 both little_r and SURFRAD formats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The input ASCII point observation format consists of one row of data per
 observation value.
 Each row of data consists of 11 columns as shown in the following table.

\begin_layout Section
Pcp-Combine tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
This section contains a description of running the Pcp-Combine tool.
 The Pcp-Combine tool is used (if needed) to modify the precipitation accumulati
on intervals from two or more gridded files into a single NetCDF file containing
 the desired accumulation interval, for input to the MET statistics tools.
 The "sum" command can only be run on GRIB1 or GRIB2 files while "add" and
 "subtract" can be run on any gridded file.
 Use of Pcp-Combine on a single file will result in that file being written
 out in NetCDF format, with no changes to the content.
 The files being combined must have already been placed on the grid on which
 the user would like to verify.
 The copygb utility is recommended for re-gridding GRIB files.
 In addition, the Pcp-Combine tool will only operate on files with the same
 initialization time unless it is indicated that it shoud ignore the initializat
ion time.

This section contains a description of running the Gen-Poly-Mask tool.
 The Gen-Poly-Mask tool may be run to create a bitmap verification masking
 region to be used by the Grid-Stat, Point-Stat, and MODE tools.
 This tool enables the user to generate a polyline masking region once for
 a domain and apply it to many cases.
 When using a complex polyline containing hundreds of vertices, it is a
 good idea to use the Gen-Poly-Mask tool to create a bitmap masking region
 before running the other MET tools as doing so will make them run more
 efficiently.
