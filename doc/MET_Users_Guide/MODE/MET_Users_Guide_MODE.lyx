\begin_layout Standard
This chapter provides a description of the Method for Object-Based Diagnostic
 Evaluation (MODE) tool, which was developed at the Research Applications
 Laboratory, NCAR/Boulder, USA.
 More information about MODE can be found in Davis 
\emph on
et al.

\emph default
 (2006a, b) and Brown 
\emph on
et al.

\emph default
 (2007).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MODE was developed in response to a need for verification methods that can
 provide diagnostic information that is more directly useful and meaningful
 than the information that can be obtained from traditional verification
 approaches, especially in application to high-resolution NWP output.
 The MODE approach was originally developed for application to spatial precipita
tion forecasts, but it can also be applied to other fields with coherent
 spatial structures (
\shape italic
e.g.
\shape default
, clouds, convection).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MODE is only one of a number of different approaches that have been developed
 in recent years to meet these needs.
 In the future, we expect that the MET package will include additional methods.
 References for many of these methods are provided at

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MODE may be used in a generalized way to compare any two fields.
 For simplicity, field1 may be thought of in this chapter as ``the forecast,''
 while field2 may be thought of as ``the observation'', which is usually
 a gridded analysis of some sort.
 The convention of field1/field2 is also used in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "MODE_object_attribute"

\end_inset

.
 MODE resolves objects in both the forecast and observed fields.
 These objects mimic what humans would call ``regions of interest.'' Object
 attributes are calculated and compared, and are used to associate (``merge'')
 objects within a single field, as well as to ``match'' objects between
 the forecast and observed fields.
 Finally, summary statistics describing the objects and object pairs are
 produced.
 These statistics can be used to identify correlations and differences among
 the objects, leading to insights concerning forecast strengths and weaknesses.

Resolving objects

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process used for resolving objects in a raw data field is called 
\shape italic
convolution thresholding
\shape default
.
 The raw data field is first convolved with a simple filter function as
 follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$$C(x,y)=
\backslash
sum 
\backslash
phi (u,v)f(x-u)(y-v).$$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this formula, 
\emph on
f
\emph default
 is the raw data field, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is the filter function, and 
\emph on
C
\emph default
 is the resulting convolved field.
 The variables (
\emph on
x, y
\emph default
) and (
\emph on
u, v
\emph default
) are grid coordinates.
 The filter function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is a simple circular filter determined by a radius of influence 
\emph on
R
\emph default
, and a height 
\emph on
H
\emph default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$$
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
phi(x, y) = 
\backslash
cases{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   H & if $x^2 + y^2 
\backslash

\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   0 & otherwise.
 
\backslash
cr
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}$$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parameters 
\emph on
R
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
H
\emph default
 are not independent.
 They are related by the requirement that the integral of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 over the grid be unity: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$$
\backslash
pi R^2H=1.$$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, the radius of influence 
\emph on
R
\emph default
 is the only tunable parameter in the convolution process.
 Once 
\emph on
R
\emph default
 is chosen, 
\emph on
H
\emph default
 is determined by the above equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the convolved field, 
\emph on
C
\emph default
, is in hand, it is thresholded to create a mask field, 
\emph on
M
\emph default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objects are the connected regions where 
\emph on
M = 1
\emph default
.
 Finally, the raw data are restored to object interiors to obtain the object
 field, 
\emph on
F
\emph default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$$F(x,y)=M(x,y)f(x,y).$$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, two parameters --- the radius of influence, 
\emph on
R
\emph default
, and the threshold, 
\emph on
T
\emph default
 --- control the entire process of resolving objects in the raw data field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of the steps involved in resolving objects is shown in Figure

 after the threshold is applied.
 Finally, Fig.

Attributes
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:MODE_Attributes"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object attributes are defined both for single objects and for object pairs.
 One of the objects in a pair is from the forecast field and the other is
 taken from the observed field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
bf Area}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is simply a count of the number of grid squares an object occupies.
 If desired, a true area (say, in 
\begin_inset Formula $km^{2}$
\end_inset

) can be obtained by adding up the true areas of all the grid squares inside
 an object, but in practice this is deemed not to be necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moments are used in the calculation of several object attributes.
 If we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(x,y)$
\end_inset

 to be 1 for points (
\emph on
x, y
\emph default
) inside our object, and zero for points outside, then the first-order moments,
 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S{}_{y}$
\end_inset

, are defined as 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$$S_x=
\backslash
sum_{x,y} x 
\backslash
, 
\backslash
xi (x,y) 
\backslash
hskip 0.25in 
\backslash
hbox{and} 
\backslash
hskip 0.25in S_y=
\backslash
sum_{x,y} y 
\backslash
, 
\backslash
xi (x,y).$$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Higher order moments are similarly defined and are used in the calculation
 of some of the other attributes.
 For example, the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
bf centroid}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is a kind of geometric center of an object, and can be calculated from
 first moments.
 It allows one to assign a single point location to what may be a large,
 extended object.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
bf Axis Angle}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, is calculated from the second-order moments.
 It gives information on the orientation or ``tilt'' of an object.
 Curvature is another attribute that uses moments in its calculation, specifical
ly, third-order moments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
bf Aspect Ratio}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is computed by fitting a rectangle around an object.
 The rectangle is aligned so that it has the same axis angle as the object,
 and the length and width are chosen so as to just enclose the object.
 We make no claim that the rectangle so obtained is the smallest possible
 rectangle enclosing the given object.
 However, this rectangle is much easier to calculate than a smallest enclosing
 rectangle and serves our purposes just as well.
 Once the rectangle is determined, the aspect ratio of the object is defined
 to be the width of the rectangle divided by its length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another object attribute defined by MODE is 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
bf complexity}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Complexity is defined by comparing the area of an object to the area of
 its convex hull.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the attributes discussed so far are defined for single objects.
 Once these are determined, they can be used to calculate attributes for
 pairs of objects.
 One example is 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
bf centroid difference}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This measure is simply the (vector) difference between the centroids of
 the two objects.
 Another example is 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
angle difference}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the difference between the axis angles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several area measures are also used for pair attributes.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
bf Union Area}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is the total area that is in either one (or both) of the two objects.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
bf Intersection Area}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is the area that is inside both objects simultaneously.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{Symmetrid Difference}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is the area inside at least one object, but not inside both.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fuzzy logic
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:MODE_Fuzzy-logic"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once object attributes 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\ldots,\alpha_{n}$
\end_inset

 are estimated, some of them are used as input to a fuzzy logic engine that
 performs the matching and merging steps.
 Merging refers to grouping together objects in a single field, while matching
 refers to grouping together objects in different fields, typically the
 forecast and observed fields.
 Interest maps, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$
\end_inset

, are applied to the individual attributes, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

, to convert them into interest values, which range from zero (representing
 no interest) to one (high interest).
 For example, the default interest map for centroid difference is one for
 small distances, and falls to zero as the distance increases.
 For other attributes (e.g., intersection area), low values indicate low interest,
 and high values indicate more interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step is to define confidence maps, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

, for each attribute.
 These maps (again with values ranging from zero to one) reflect how confident
 we are in the calculated value of an attribute.
 The confidence maps generally are functions of the entire attribute vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\ldots,\alpha_{n}$
\end_inset

, in contrast to the interest maps, where each 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a function only of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 To see why this is necessary, imagine an electronic anemometer that outputs
 a stream of numerical values of wind speed and direction.
 It is typically the case for such devices that when the wind speed becomes
 small enough, the wind direction is poorly resolved.
 The wind must be at least strong enough to overcome friction and turn the
 anemometer.
 Thus, in this case, our confidence in one attribute (wind direction) is
 dependent on the value of another attribute (wind speed).
 In MODE, all of the confidence maps except the map for axis angle are set
 to a constant value of 1.
 The axis angle confidence map is a function of aspect ratio, with values
 near one having low confidence, and values far from one having high confidence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, scalar weights, 
\emph on
w
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $_{i}$
\end_inset

, are assigned to each attribute, representing an empirical judgment regarding
 the relative importance of the various attributes.
 As an example, the initial development of MODE, centroid distance was weighted
 more heavily than other attributes, because the location of storm systems
 close to each other in space seemed to be a strong indication (stronger
 than that given by any other attribute) that they were related.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, all these ingredients are collected into a single number called
 the total interest, 
\emph on
T
\emph default
, given by 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$$T(
\backslash
alpha)={{
\backslash
sum_iw_iC_i(
\backslash
alpha)I_i(
\backslash
alpha_i)}
\backslash
over{
\backslash
sum_i w_iC_i(
\backslash
alpha)}}.$$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This total interest value is then thresholded, and pairs of objects that
 have total interest values above the threshold are merged (if they are
 in the same field) or matched (if they are in different fields).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another merging method is available in MODE, which can be used instead of,
 or along with, the fuzzy logic based merging just described.
 Recall that the convolved field was thresholded to produce the mask field.
 A second (lower) threshold can be specified so that objects that are separated
 at the higher threshold but joined at the lower threshold are merged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Summary statistics
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:MODE_Summary-statistics"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once MODE has been run, summary statistics are written to an output file.
 These files contain information about all single and cluster objects and
 their attributes.
 Total interest for object pairs is also output, as are percentiles of intensity
 inside the objects.
 The output file is in a simple flat ASCII tabular format (with one header
 line) and thus should be easily readable by just about any programming
 language, scripting language, or statistics package.
 Refer to Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:MODE-output"

\end_inset

 for lists of the statistics included in the MODE output files.
 Example scripts will be posted on the MET website in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Practical information
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:MODE_Practical-information"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section contains a description of how MODE can be configured and run.
 The MODE tool is used to perform a features-based verification of gridded
 model data using gridded observations.
 The input gridded model and observation datasets must be in one of the
 MET supported gridded file formats.
 In both cases, the input model and observation dataset must be on a common
 grid.
 The gridded analysis data may be based on observations, such as Stage II
 or Stage IV data for verifying accumulated precipitation, or a model analysis
 field may be used.
 However, users are cautioned that it is generally unwise to verify model
 output using an analysis field produced by the same model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MODE provides the capability to select a single model variable/level from
 which to derive objects to be analyzed.
 MODE was developed and tested using accumulated precipitation.
 However, the code has been generalized to allow the use of any gridded
 model and observation field.
 Based on the options specified in the configuration file, MODE will define
 a set of simple objects in the model and observation fields.
 It will then compute an interest value for each pair of objects across
 the fields using a fuzzy engine approach.
 Those interest values are thresholded, and any pairs of objects above the
 threshold will be matched/merged.
 Through the configuration file, MODE offers a wide range of flexibility
 in how the objects are defined, processed, matched, and merged.

 The 
\series bold
-config_merge merge_config_file
\series default
 argument indicates the name of a second configuration file to be used when
 performing fuzzy engine merging by comparing the model or observation field
 to itself.
 The MODE tool provides the capability of performing merging within a single
 field by comparing the field to itself.
 Interest values are computed for each object and all of its neighbors.
 If an object and its neighbor have an interest value above some threshold,
 they are merged.
 The 
\series bold
merge_config_file
\series default
 controls the settings of the fuzzy engine used to perform this merging
 step.
 If a 
\series bold

 previous argument will be used.

-log file 
\series default
option directs output and errors to the specified log file.
 All messages will be written to that file as well as cout and cerr.
 Thus, users can save the messages without having to redirect the output
 on the command line.
 The default behavior is no logfile.

 The 
\series bold
-v level

 The contents of "level" will override the default setting of 2.
 Setting the verbosity to 0 will make the tool run with no log messages,
 while increasing the verbosity above 1 will increase the amount of logging.

 Prior to defining objects, it is recommended that the raw fields should

 The thresholds can be specified using symbols.

The 
\family typewriter
match_flag
\family default
 variable controls how matching will be performed when comparing objects
 from the forecast field to objects from the observation field.
 An interest value is computed for each possible pair of forecast/observation
 objects.
 The interest values are then thresholded to define which objects match.
 If two objects in one field happen to match the same object in the other
 field, then those two objects could be merged.
 The

\begin_layout Standard
Computing the attributes for all possible pairs of objects can take some
 time depending on the numbers of objects.
 The 
\family typewriter
max_centroid_dist
\family default
 variable is used to specify how far apart objects should be in order to
 conclude that they have no chance of matching.
 No pairwise attributes are computed for pairs of objects whose centroids
 are farther away than this distance, defined in terms of grid units.
 Setting this variable to a reasonable value will improve the execution
 time of the MODE tool.
 By default, the maximum centroid distance is defined in terms of the previously

Similar to the

grid
\family default
 variable above, the 
\family typewriter
poly
\family default
 variable is the name of a file that defines a verification masking region.
 These masking regions may be specified in two ways: as a lat/lon polygon
 or using a gridded data file such as the NetCDF output of the Gen-Poly-Mask
 or Gen-Circle_Mask tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several masking polygons used by NCEP are predefined in the installed share/met/
poly directory.
 Creating a new polygon is as simple as creating a text file with a name
 for the polygon followed by the lat/lon points which define its boundary.
 Adding a new masking polygon requires no code changes and no recompiling.
 Internally, the lat/lon polygon points are converted into x/y values in
 the grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, any gridded data file that MET can read may be used to define
 a verification masking region.
 Users must specify a description of the field to be used from the input
 file and, optionally, may specify a threshold to be applied to that field.
 Any grid point where the resulting field is 0, the mask is turned off.
 Any grid point where it is non-zero, the mask is turned on.

The set of interest function variables listed above define which values
 are of interest for each pairwise attribute measured.
 The interest functions may be defined as a piecewise linear function or
 as an algebraic expression.
 A piecewise linear function is defined by specifying the corner points
 of its graph.
 An algebraic function may be defined in terms of several built-in mathematical
 functions.

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
color_table
\family default
 variables indicate which color table files are to be used when generating
 the output PostScript plot.
 The forecast and observation raw field are plotted using values in the
 
\family typewriter
fcst_raw
\family default
 group and 
\family typewriter
obs_raw
\family default
 group, while the objects identified are plotted using the values in the
 
\family typewriter
object_plot
\family default
 group.
 By default, these variables point to color tables in the MET distribution.
 Users are free to create their own color tables following the format in
 the examples.
 Note that the range defined for the default raw color table is 0 to 1.
 By convention, when a color table is defined with a range of 0 to 1, it
 will be scaled to match the actual range of the data present in raw field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
plot_min
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
plot_max
\family default
 variables indicate the min and max data values to be plotted for the forecast
 and observation fields.
 If set to non-zero values, the forecast and observation raw color tables
 specified above will be rescaled to match the specified range.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MODE tool generates a color bar to represent the contents of the colortable
 that was used to plot a field of data.
 The number of entries in the color bar matches the number of entries in
 the color table.
 The values defined for each color in the color table are also plotted next
 to the color bar.
 The 
\family typewriter
colorbar_spacing
\family default
 variable is used to define the frequency with which the color table values
 should be plotted.
 Setting this variable to 1, as shown above, indicates that every color
 table value should be plotted.
 Setting it to an integer, n > 1, indicates that only every nth color table
 value should be plotted.

 be cut in half.
 Shifting the grid by some amount enables the user to control where that

 The first ASCII file contains contingency table counts and statistics for
 comparing the forecast and observation fields.
 This file consists of 4 lines.
 The first is a header line containing column names.
 The second line contains data comparing the two raw fields after any masking
 of bad data or based on a grid or lat/lon polygon has been applied.
 The third contains data comparing the two fields after any raw thresholds
 have been applied.
 The fourth, and last, line contains data comparing the derived object fields
 scored using traditional measures.

\begin_layout Standard
The second ASCII file the MODE tool generates contains all of the attributes
 for simple objects, the merged cluster objects, and pairs of objects.
 Each line in this file contains the same number of columns, though those
 columns not applicable to a given line contain fill data.
 The first row of every MODE object attribute file is a header containing
 the column names.
 The number of lines in this file depends on the number of objects defined.
 This file contains lines of 6 types that are indicated by the contents
 of the 
\family typewriter
object_id
\family default
 column.
 The 
\family typewriter
object_id
\family default
 can take the following 6 forms: 
\family typewriter
FNNN
\family default
\series bold
, 
\family typewriter
\series default
ONNN
\family default
\series bold
, 
\family typewriter
\series default
FNNN_ONNN
\family default
\series bold
, 
\family typewriter
\series default
CFNNN
\family default
\series bold
, 
\family typewriter
\series default
CONNN
\family default
\series bold
, 
\family typewriter
\series default
CFNNN_CONNN
\family default
\series bold
.

\series default
 In each case, 
\family typewriter
NNN
\family default
 is a three-digit number indicating the object index.
 While all lines have the first 18 header columns in common, these 6 forms
 for 
\family typewriter
object_id
\family default
 can be divided into two types - one for single objects and one for pairs
 of objects.
 The single object lines (
\family typewriter
FNNN
\family default
\series bold
, 
\family typewriter
\series default
ONNN
\family default
\series bold
, 
\family typewriter
\series default
CFNNN
\family default
\series bold
,
\series default
 and 
\family typewriter
CONNN
\family default
) contain valid data in columns 19--39 and fill data in columns 40--51.
 The object pair lines (
\family typewriter
FNNN_ONNN
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
CFNNN_CONNN
\family default
) contain valid data in columns 40--51 and fill data in columns 19--39.
 These object identifiers are described in Table

A note on terminology:
\series default
 a cluster (referred to as "composite" in earlier versions) object need
 not necessarily consist of more than one simple object.
 A cluster object is by definition any set of one or more objects in one
 field which match a set of one or more objects in the other field.
 When a single simple forecast object matches a single simple observation
 object, they are each considered to be cluster objects as well.

The MODE tool creates a NetCDF output file containing the object fields
 that are defined.
 The NetCDF file contains gridded fields including indices for the simple
 forecast objects, indices for the simple observation objects, indices for
 the matched cluster forecast objects, and indices for the matched cluster
 observation objects.
 The NetCDF file also contains lat/lon and x/y data for the vertices of
 the polygons for the boundaries of the simple forecast and observation
 objects.
 The generation of this file can be disabled using the

Lastly, the MODE tool creates a PostScript plot summarizing the features-based
 approach used in the verification.
 The PostScript plot is generated using internal libraries and does not
 depend on an external plotting package.
 The generation of this PostScript output can be disabled using the 
\family typewriter
ps_plot_flag
\family default
 configuration file option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PostScript plot will contain 5 summary pages at a minimum, but the number
 of pages will depend on the merging options chosen.
 Additional pages will be created if merging is performed using the double
 thresholding or fuzzy engine merging techniques for the forecast and/or
 observation fields.
 Examples of the PostScript plots can be obtained by running the example
 cases provided with the MET tarball.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first page of PostScript output contains a great deal of summary information.
 Six tiles of images provide thumbnail images of the raw fields, matched/merged
 object fields, and object index fields for the forecast and observation
 grids.
 In the matched/merged object fields, matching colors of objects across
 fields indicate that the corresponding objects match, while within a single
 field, black outlines indicate merging.
 Note that objects that are colored royal blue are unmatched.
 Along the bottom of the page, the criteria used for object definition and
 matching/merging are listed.
 Along the right side of the page, total interest values for pairs of simple
 objects are listed in sorted order.
 The numbers in this list correspond to the object indices shown in the
 object index plots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second and third pages of the PostScript output file display enlargements
 of the forecast and observation raw and object fields, respectively.
 The fourth page displays the forecast object with the outlines of the observati
on objects overlaid, and vice versa.
 The fifth page contains summary information about the pairs of matched
 cluster objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the double threshold merging or the fuzzy engine merging techniques have
 been applied, the output from those steps is summarized on additional pages.
