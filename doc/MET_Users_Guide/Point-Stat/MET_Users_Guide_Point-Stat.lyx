The Point-Stat Tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The Point-Stat tool provides verification statistics for forecasts at observatio
n points (as opposed to over gridded analyses).
 The Point-Stat tool matches gridded forecasts to point observation locations,
 using several different interpolation approaches.
 The tool then computes continuous as well as categorical verification statistic
s.
 The categorical and probabilistic statistics generally are derived by applying
 a threshold to the forecast and observation values.
 Confidence intervals - representing the uncertainty in the verification
 measures - are computed for the verification statistics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Scientific and statistical aspects of the Point-Stat tool are discussed
 in the following section.
 Practical aspects of the Point-Stat tool are described in Section 4.3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Scientific and statistical aspects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The statistical methods and measures computed by the Point-Stat tool are
 described briefly in this section.
 In addition, Section 4.2.1 discusses the various interpolation options available
 for matching the forecast grid point values to the observation points.
 The statistical measures computed by the Point-Stat tool are described
 briefly in Section 4.2.2 and in more detail in Appendix C.
 Section 4.2.3 describes the methods for computing confidence intervals that
 are applied to some of the measures computed by the Point-Stat tool; more
 detail on confidence intervals is provided in Appendix D.

\begin_layout Subsection
Interpolation/matching methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
This section provides information about the various methods available in
 MET to match gridded model output to point observations.
 Matching in the vertical and horizontal are completed separately using
 different methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
In the vertical, if forecasts and observations are at the same vertical
 level, then they are paired as is.
 If any discrepancy exists between the vertical levels, then the forecasts
 are interpolated to the level of the observation.
 The vertical interpolation is done in natural log of pressure coordinates,
 except for specific humidity, which is interpolated using the natural log
 of specific humidity in natural log of pressure coordinates.
 When forecasts are for the surface, no interpolation is done.
 They are matched to observations with message type ADPSFC or SFCSHP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
To match forecasts and observations in the horizontal plane, the user can
 select from a number of methods described below.
 Many of these methods require the user to define the width of the forecast
 grid W, around each observation point P, that should be considered.
 For example, a width of 2 defines a 2 x 2 square of grid points enclosing
 P, or simply the 4 grid points closest to P.
 A width of 3 defines a 3 x 3 square consisting of 9 grid points centered
 on the grid point closest to P.
 Fig.
 4-1 provides illustration.
 The point P denotes the observation location where the interpolated value
 is calculated.
 The interpolation width W, shown is five.

The forecast value at P is assigned the value at the nearest grid point.
 No interpolation is performed.
 Here, "nearest" means spatially closest in horizontal grid coordinates.
 This method is used by default when the interpolation width, W, is set
 to 1.

The forecast value at P is a weighted sum of the values in the W x W square.
 The weight given to each forecast point is the reciprocal of the square
 of the distance (in grid coordinates) from P.
 The weighted sum of forecast values is normalized by dividing by the sum
 of the weights.

Least-Squares Fit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
To perform least squares interpolation of a gridded field at a location
 P, MET uses an 
\emph on
WxW
\emph default
 subgrid centered (as closely as possible) at P.
 Figure 4-1 shows the case where N = 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
If we denote the horizontal coordinate in this subgrid by x, and vertical
 coordinate by y, then we can assign coordinates to the point P relative
 to this subgrid.
 These coordinates are chosen so that the center of the grid is .
 In the figure, for example, P has coordinates (-0.4, 0.2).
 Since the grid is centered near P, the coordinates of P should always be
 at most 0.5 in absolute value.
 At each of the vertices of the grid (indicated by black dots in the figure),
 we have data values.
 We would like to use these values to interpolate a value at P.
 We do this using least squares.
 If we denote the interpolated value by z, then we fit an expression of
 the form
\series default
 
\begin_inset ERT

$z=

 are calculated from the data values at the vertices.
 Finally, the coordinates (

 then the other to the location of the observation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Statistical measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The Point-Stat tool computes a wide variety of verification statistics.
 Broadly speaking, these statistics can be subdivided into statistics for
 categorical variables and statistics for continuous variables.
 The categories of measures are briefly described here; specific descriptions
 of the measures are provided in Appendix C.
 Additional information can be found in Wilks (2006) and Jolliffe and Stephenson
 (2003), and on the world-wide web at

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
In addition to these verification measures, the Point-Stat tool also computes
 partial sums and other FHO statistics that are produced by the NCEP verificatio
n system.
 These statistics are also described in Appendix C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Measures for categorical variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Categorical verification statistics are used to evaluate forecasts that
 are in the form of a discrete set of categories rather than on a continuous
 scale.
 Currently, Point-Stat computes categorical statistics for variables in
 two or more categories.
 The special case of dichotomous (i.e., 2-category) variables has several
 types of statistics calculated from the resulting contingency table and
 are available in the CTS output line type.
 For multi-category variables, fewer statistics can be calculated so these
 are available separately, in line type MCTS.
 Categorical variables can be intrinsic (e.g., rain/no-rain) or they may be
 formed by applying one or more thresholds to a continuous variable (e.g.,
 temperature < 273.15?K or cloud coverage percentages in 10% bins).
 See Appendix C for more information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Measures for continuous variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For continuous variables, many verification measures are based on the forecast
 error (i.e., f - o).
 However, it also is of interest to investigate characteristics of the forecasts
, and the observations, as well as their relationship.
 These concepts are consistent with the general framework for verification
 outlined by Murphy and Winkler (1987).
 The statistics produced by MET for continuous forecasts represent this
 philosophy of verification, which focuses on a variety of aspects of performanc
e rather than a single measure.
 See Appendix C for specific information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Measures for probabilistic forecasts and dichotomous outcomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For probabilistic forecasts, many verification measures are based on reliability
, accuracy and bias.
 However, it also is of interest to investigate joint and conditional distributi
ons of the forecasts and the observations, as in Wilks (2006).
 See Appendix C for specific information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Probabilistic forecast values are assumed to have a range of either 0 to
 1 or 0 to 100.
 If the max data value is > 1, we assume the data range is 0 to 100, and
 divide all the values by 100.
 If the max data value is <= 1, then we use the values as is.
 Further, thresholds are applied to the probabilities with equality on the
 lower end.
 For example, with a forecast probability p, and thresholds t1 and t2, the
 range is defined as: t1 <= p < t2.
 The exception is for the highest set of thresholds, when the range includes
 1: t1 <= p <= 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Statistical confidence intervals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
A single summary score gives an indication of the forecast performance,
 but it is a single realization from a random process that neglects uncertainty
 in the score's estimate.
 That is, it is possible to obtain a good score, but it may be that the
 "good" score was achieved by chance and does not reflect the "true" score.
 Therefore, when interpreting results from a verification analysis, it is
 imperative to analyze the uncertainty in the realized scores.
 One good way to do this is to utilize confidence intervals.
 A confidence interval indicates that if the process were repeated many
 times, say 100, then the true score would fall within the interval 100(1-?)%
 of the time.
 Typical values of ? are 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.
 The Point-Stat tool allows the user to select one or more specific ?-values
 to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For continuous fields (e.g., temperature), it is possible to estimate confidence
 intervals for some measures of forecast performance based on the assumption
 that the data, or their errors, are normally distributed.
 The Point-Stat tool computes confidence intervals for the following summary
 measures: forecast mean and standard deviation, observation mean and standard
 deviation, correlation, mean error, and the standard deviation of the error.
 In the case of the respective means, the central limit theorem suggests
 that the means are normally distributed, and this assumption leads to the
 usual 100(1-?)% confidence intervals for the mean.
 For the standard deviations of each field, one must be careful to check
 that the field of interest is normally distributed, as this assumption
 is necessary for the interpretation of the resulting confidence intervals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For the measures relating the two fields (i.e., mean error, correlation and
 standard deviation of the errors), confidence intervals are based on either
 the joint distributions of the two fields (e.g., with correlation) or on
 a function of the two fields.
 For the correlation, the underlying assumption is that the two fields follow
 a bivariate normal distribution.
 In the case of the mean error and the standard deviation of the mean error,
 the assumption is that the errors are normally distributed, which for continuou
s variables, is usually a reasonable assumption, even for the standard deviation
 of the errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Bootstrap confidence intervals for any verification statistic are available
 in MET.
 Bootstrapping is a nonparametric statistical method for estimating parameters
 and uncertainty information.
 The idea is to obtain a sample of the verification statistic(s) of interest
 (e.g., bias, ETS, etc.) so that inferences can be made from this sample.
 The assumption is that the original sample of matched forecast-observation
 pairs is representative of the population.
 Several replicated samples are taken with replacement from this set of
 forecast-observation pairs of variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature,
 etc.), and the statistic(s) are calculated for each replicate.
 That is, given a set of n forecast-observation pairs, we draw values at
 random from these pairs, allowing the same pair to be drawn more than once,
 and the statistic(s) is (are) calculated for each replicated sample.
 This yields a sample of the statistic(s) based solely on the data without
 making any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the sample.
 It should be noted, however, that if the observed sample of matched pairs
 is dependent, then this dependence should be taken into account somehow.
 Currently, in the confidence interval methods in MET do not take into account
 dependence, but future releases will support a robust method allowing for
 dependence in the original sample.
 More detailed information about the bootstrap algorithm is found in the
 appendix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Confidence intervals can be calculated from the sample of verification statistic
s obtained through the bootstrap algorithm.
 The most intuitive method is to simply take the appropriate quantiles of
 the sample of statistic(s).
 For example, if one wants a 95% CI, then one would take the 2.5 and 97.5
 percentiles of the resulting sample.
 This method is called the percentile method, and has some nice properties.
 However, if the original sample is biased and/or has non-constant variance,
 then it is well known that this interval is too optimistic.
 The most robust, accurate, and well-behaved way to obtain accurate CIs
 from bootstrapping is to use the bias corrected and adjusted percentile
 method (or BCa).
 If there is no bias, and the variance is constant, then this method will
 yield the usual percentile interval.
 The only drawback to the approach is that it is computationally intensive.
 Therefore, both the percentile and BCa methods are available in MET, with
 the considerably more efficient percentile method being the default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The only other option associated with bootstrapping currently available
 in MET is to obtain replicated samples smaller than the original sample
 (i.e., to sample m<n points at each replicate).
 Ordinarily, one should use m=n, and this is the default.
 However, there are cases where it is more appropriate to use a smaller
 value of m (e.g., when making inference about high percentiles of the original
 sample).
 See Gilleland (2008) for more information and references about this topic.

\begin_layout Section
Practical information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
This section contains a description of how to configure and run the Point-Stat
 tool.
 The Point-Stat tool is used to perform verification of a gridded model
 field using point observations.
 The gridded model field to be verified must be in one of the supported
 file formats.
 The point observations must be in NetCDF format as the output of the 
\emph on
pb2nc
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
ascii2nc
\emph default
 step.
 The Point-Stat tool provides the capability of interpolating the gridded
 forecast data to the observation points using a variety of methods as described
 in Section 4.2.1.
 The Point-Stat tool computes a number of continuous statistics on the matched
 pair data as well as discrete statistics once the matched pair data have
 been thresholded.

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
fcst
\series medium
 group contains information about the model forecast fields, levels and
 threshold to use in verification.
 The 
\series default
field
\series medium
 variable contains a comma-separated list of model variables and corresponding
 vertical levels to be verified.
 Each field is specified by giving its name an accumulation or vertical
 level indicators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For GRIB files, the GRIB code itself or the corresponding abbreviation may
 be used to specify which model fields are to be verified.
 A level indicator in the form 
\series default
"ANNN", "ZNNN", "PNNN", "PNNN-NNN", "LNNN"
\series medium
, or 
\series default
"RNNN"
\series medium
 must correspond to each field name.
 These indicate an accumulation interval, a single vertical level, a single
 pressure level, a range of pressure levels, a generic level, and a specific
 GRIB record number, respectively.
 
\series default
"NNN"
\series medium
 indicates the accumulation or level value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
To specify verification fields for NetCDF files, the name of the NetCDF
 variable should appear in the name field.
 The level field should be of the form (i,...,j,*,*) for a single field.
 Here, i,...,j specifies fixed dimension values, and *,* specifies the two
 dimensions for the gridded field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The values listed above indicate that temperature, height, and the U and
 V components of the winds should all be verified.
 All variables are treated as scalar quantities with the exception of the
 U and V components of the wind.
 When the U component is followed by the V component, both with the same
 level indicator, they will be treated as vector quantities.
 A list of GRIB codes is available at 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/on388/table2.html"

\end_inset

.
 Wind speed is typically not available in model files, but if it is, it
 will be used directly.
 However, if wind speed is unavailable but the U and V components of the
 wind are included, the wind speed will be calculated automatically by MET,
 provided that WIND is included in the 
\series default
field
\series medium
 group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For each 
\series default
name
\series medium
 listed in the forecast field, one or more thresholds must be specified
 if categorical statistics have been requested.
 The thresholds are specified using ==, >=, >, !=, <, <=.
 Multiple thresholds may be applied to each field code by providing a comma-sepa
rated list within the double quotes (e.g.
 >0, <=0) It is the user's responsibility to know the units for each model
 variable and to choose appropriate threshold values.
 For probabilistic forecast, thresholds must be specified using >= convention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
To indicate that a forecast field should be treated as probabilities, set
 the 
\series default
prob
\series medium
 field to TRUE.
 Probability fields should contain values in the range [0, 1] or [0, 100].
 However, when MET encounters a probability field with a range [0, 100],
 it will automatically rescale it to be [0, 1] before applying the probabilistic
 verification methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
obs
\series medium
 group can be defined in the same way as the forecast group.
 When verifying GRIB1 forecast files, setting obs=fcst to use the same settings
 will be most valuable, since point observations are specified using GRIB1
 conventions.
 The variables are identical to those in the 
\series default
fcst
\series medium
 except that they apply to the observation field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For each observation field, one or more thresholds can be specified for
 use in computing discrete statistics.
 Specification is done exactly as for 
\series default
cat_thresh
\series medium
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
When verifying winds via either the u and v components or the speed and
 direction, it can be desirable to eliminate winds below a certain speed.
 The 
\series default
wind_thresh
\series medium
 filters the winds based on speed, even when u and v winds are input.
 Format is the same as for 
\series default
cat_thresh
\series medium
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The Point-Stat tool performs verification using observations for one message
 type at a time.
 The 
\series default
message_type
\series medium
 variable contains a comma-separated list of the message types to use for
 verification.
 By default, only surface and upper air observations are used for verification.
 At least one 
\series default
message_type
\series medium
 must be provided.

 Here it is defined in the forecast dictionary and then copies to the observatio
n dictionary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The

The 
\series default
mask
\series medium
 group contains variables to define the verification grid.
 The 
\series default
grid
\series medium
 variable contains a comma-separated list of pre-defined NCEP grids over
 which to perform the Point-Stat verification.
 The predefined grids are specified as "
\series default
GNNN
\series medium
" where 
\series default
NNN
\series medium
 is the three digit designation for the grid.
 Defining a new grid would require code changes and recompiling MET.
 Supplying a value of "
\series default
FULL
\series medium
" indicates that the verification should be performed over the entire grid
 on which the data resides.
 The value listed above indicates that verification should be performed
 over the NCEP Grid number 212.
 See Appendix B for a list of grids that will be accepted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
poly
\series medium
 variable contains a comma-separated list of files that define verification
 masking regions.
 These masking regions may be specified in two ways: as a lat/lon polygon
 or using a gridded data file such as the NetCDF output of the Gen-Poly-Mask
 or Gen-Circle_Mask tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Several masking polygons used by NCEP are predefined in the share/met/poly
 installation directory.
 Creating a new polygon is as simple as creating a text file with a name
 for the polygon followed by the lat/lon points which define its boundary.
 Adding a new masking polygon requires no code changes and no recompiling.
 Internally, the lat/lon polygon points are converted into x/y values in
 the grid.
 The lat/lon values for the observation points are also converted into x/y
 grid coordinates.
 The computations performed to check whether the observation point falls
 within the polygon defined is done in x/y grid space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Alternatively, any gridded data file that MET can read may be used to define
 a verification masking region.
 Users must specify a description of the field to be used from the input
 file and, optionally, may specify a threshold to be applied to that field.
 Once this threshold is applied, any grid point where the resulting field
 is 0, the mask is turned off.
 Any grid point where it is non-zero, the mask is turned on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
sid
\series medium
 variable is specified as an array of strings.
 Each entry in that array is either the name of a single station id or a
 filename.
 If it is a single station id name, that station will be treated as its
 own masking region, as in previous versions of MET.
 If it's a filename, that file should contain a "name" followed by a space-separ
ated list of station id's.
 That first "name" entry is what MET puts in the VX_MASK output column.
 This provides a way to define one or more groups of individual stations
 over which to compute statistics.
 This is an alternative to defining a masking region using a polyline or
 grid and is more convenient if you have a specific list of station id's
 you'd like to use.

 The confidence interval computed is 1 minus the ci_alpha value.
 The value of 0.05 listed above indicates that the 95th percentile confidence

The

boot
\series medium
 group defines the parameters to be used in calculation of bootstrap confidence
 intervals.
 The 
\series default
interval
\series medium
 variable indicates what method should be used for computing bootstrap confidenc
e intervals.
 A value of BCA indicates that the highly accurate but computationally intensive
 BCa (bias-corrected percentile) method should be used.
 A value of PCTILE indicates that the somewhat less accurate but efficient
 percentile method should be used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
rep_prop
\series medium
 variable must be set to a value between 0 and 1.
 When computing bootstrap confidence intervals over n sets of matched pairs,
 the size of the subsample, m, may be chosen less than or equal to the size
 of the sample, n.
 This variable defines the size of m as a proportion relative to the size
 of n.
 A value of 1, as shown above, indicates that the size of the subsample,
 m, should be equal to the size of the sample, n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
n_rep
\series medium
 variable defines the number of subsamples that should be taken when computing
 bootstrap confidence intervals.
 This variable should be set large enough so that when confidence intervals
 are computed multiple times for the same set of data, the intervals do
 not change much.
 Setting this variable to zero disables the computation of bootstrap confidence
 intervals, which may be necessary to run MET in realtime or near-realtime
 over large domains since bootstrapping is computationally expensive.
 Setting this variable to 1000, as shown above, indicates that bootstrap
 confidence interval should be computed over 1000 subsamples of the matched
 pairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The
\series default
 rng
\series medium
 variable defines the random number generator to be used in the computation
 of bootstrap confidence intervals.
 Subsamples are chosen at random from the full set of matched pairs.
 The randomness is determined by the random number generator specified.
 Users should refer to detailed documentation of the GNU Scientific Library
 for a listing of the random number generators available for use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
seed
\series medium
 variable may be set to a specific value to make the computation of bootstrap
 confidence intervals fully repeatable.
 When left empty, as shown above, the random number generator seed is chosen
 automatically which will lead to slightly different bootstrap confidence
 intervals being computed each time the data is run.
 Specifying a value here ensures that the bootstrap confidence intervals
 will be computed the same over multiple runs of the same data.

\series medium
The 
\series default
vld_thresh
\series medium
 variable contains a number between 0 and 1.
 When performing interpolation over some neighborhood of points the ratio
 of the number of valid data points to the total number of points in the
 neighborhood is computed.
 If that ratio is less than this threshold, the matched pair is discarded.
 Setting this threshold to 1, which is the default, requires that the entire
 neighborhood must contain valid data.
 This variable will typically come into play only along the boundaries of
 the verification region chosen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
method
\series medium
 variable contains a comma-separated list of interpolation methods to be

 The valid values which may be listed are MIN, MAX, MEDIAN, UW_MEAN, DW_MEAN,
 LS_FIT, and BILIN for the minimum, maximum, median, unweighted mean, distance-w
eighted mean, a least squares fit, and bilinear interpolation.
 Providing multiple interpolation methods indicates that statistics should
 be computed multiple times using a different interpolation method each
 time.
 These methods are described in Section 4.2.1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
width
\series medium
 variable contains a comma-separated list of values to be used in defining
 the neighborhoods over which the interpolation is performed.
 The neighborhood is simply a square containing the observation point.
 The 
\series default
width
\series medium
 value specifies the width of that square.
 A 
\series default
width
\series medium
 value of 1 is interpreted as the nearest neighbor model grid point to the
 observation point.
 A 
\series default
width
\series medium
 of 2 defines a 2 x 2 square of grid points around the observation point
 (the 4 closest model grid points), while a 
\series default
width
\series medium
 of 3 defines a 3 x 3 square of grid points around the observation point,
 and so on.
 The values listed above indicate that the nearest neighbor and the 4 closest
 grid points should be used to define the neighborhoods.

The 
\series default
rank_corr_flag
\series medium
 variable may be set to TRUE or FALSE to indicate whether or not Kendall's
 Tau and Spearman's Rank correlation coefficients should be computed.
 The computation of these rank correlation coefficients is very slow when
 run over many matched pairs.
 By default, this flag is turned on, as shown above, but setting it to FALSE
 should improve the runtime performance.

\emph on
point_stat
\emph default
 produces output in STAT and, optionally, ASCII format.
 The ASCII output duplicates the STAT output but has the data organized
 by line type.
 The output files will be written to the default output directory or the
 directory specified using the "-outdir" command line option.
 The output STAT file will be named using the following naming convention:
 
\series default
point_stat_PREFIX_HHMMSSL_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSSV.stat
\series medium
 where 
\series default
PREFIX
\series medium
 indicates the user-defined output prefix, 
\series default
HHMMSSL
\series medium
 indicates the forecast lead time and 
\series default
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
\series medium
 indicates the forecast valid time.
 The output ASCII files are named similarly: 
\series default
point_stat_PREFIX_HHMMSSL_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSSV_TYPE.txt
\series medium
 where 
\series default
TYPE
\series medium
 is one of 
\series default
mpr, fho, ctc, cts, cnt, mctc, mcts, pct, pstd, pjc, prc, sl1l2, sal1l2,
 vl1l2,
\series medium
 or 
\series default
val1l2
\series medium
 to indicate the line type it contains.
