The Point-Stat tool provides verification statistics for forecasts at observatio
n points (as opposed to over gridded analyses).
 The Point-Stat tool matches gridded forecasts to point observation locations
 and supports several different interpolation options.
 The tool then computes continuous, categorical, and probabilistic verification
 statistics.
 The categorical and probabilistic statistics generally are derived by applying
 a threshold to the forecast and observation values.
 Confidence intervals - representing the uncertainty in the verification
 measures - are computed for the verification statistics.

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
This section provides information about the various methods available in
 MET to match gridded model output to point observations.
 Matching in the vertical and horizontal are completed separately using
 different methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
In the vertical, if forecasts and observations are at the same vertical
 level, then they are paired as is.
 If any discrepancy exists between the vertical levels, then the forecasts
 are interpolated to the level of the observation.
 The vertical interpolation is done in natural log of pressure coordinates,
 except for specific humidity, which is interpolated using the natural log
 of specific humidity in natural log of pressure coordinates.
 Vertical interpolation for heights above ground are done linear in height
 coordinates.
 When forecasts are for the surface, no interpolation is done.
 They are matched to observations with message types that are mapped to
 
\series bold
SURFACE

 in the 
\series bold

 configuration option.
 By defualt, the surface message types include ADPSFC, SFCSHP, and MSONET.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
To match forecasts and observations in the horizontal plane, the user can
 select from a number of methods described below.
 Many of these methods require the user to define the width of the forecast
 grid W, around each observation point P, that should be considered.
 In addition, the user can select the interpolation shape, either a SQUARE
 or a CIRCLE.
 For example, a square of width 2 defines the 2 x 2 set of grid points enclosing
 P, or simply the 4 grid points closest to P.
 A square of width of 3 defines a 3 x 3 square consisting of 9 grid points
 centered on the grid point closest to P.
 Figure

 The point P denotes the observation location where the interpolated value
 is calculated.
 The interpolation width W, shown is five.

 subgrid centered (as closely as possible) at P.
 Figure

\end_inset

 shows the case where N = 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
If we denote the horizontal coordinate in this subgrid by x, and vertical
 coordinate by y, then we can assign coordinates to the point P relative
 to this subgrid.
 These coordinates are chosen so that the center of the grid is.
 For example, in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fig_Interpolation_Methods"

\end_inset

, P has coordinates (-0.4, 0.2).
 Since the grid is centered near P, the coordinates of P should always be
 at most 0.5 in absolute value.
 At each of the vertices of the grid (indicated by black dots in the figure),
 we have data values.
 We would like to use these values to interpolate a value at P.
 We do this using least squares.
 If we denote the interpolated value by z, then we fit an expression of
 the form

HiRA framework
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "subsec:PS_HiRA_framework"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The Point-Stat tool has been enhanced to include the High Resolution Assessment
 (HiRA) verification logic (Mittermaier, 2014).
 HiRA is analogous to neighborhood verification but for point observations.
 The HiRA logic interprets the forecast values surrounding each point observatio
n as an ensemble forecast.
 These ensemble values are processed in two ways.
 First, the ensemble continuous statistics (ECNT) line type is computed
 directly from the ensemble values.
 Second, for each categorical threshold specified, a fractional coverage
 value is computed as the ratio of the nearby forecast values that meet
 the threshold criteria.
 Point-Stat evaluates those fractional coverage values as if they were a
 probability forecast.
 When applying HiRA, users should enable the matched pair (MPR), probabilistic
 (PCT, PSTD, PJC, or PRC), or continuous ensemble statistics (ECNT) line
 type in the output_flag dictionary.
 The number of probabilistic HiRA output lines is determined by the number
 of categorical forecast thresholds and HiRA neighborhood widths chosen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The HiRA framework provides a unique method for evaluating models in the
 neighborhood of point observations, allowing for some spatial and temporal
 uncertainty in the forecast and / or the observations.
 Additionally, the HiRA framework can be used to compare deterministic forecasts
 to ensemble forecasts.
 In MET, the neighborhood is a circle or square centered on the grid point
 closest to the observation location.
 An event is defined, then the proportion of points with events in the neighborh
ood is calculated.
 This proportion is treated as an ensemble probability, though it is likely
 to be uncalibrated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure1.3 shows a couple of examples of how the HiRA proportion is derived
 at a single model level using square neighborhoods.
 Events (in our case, model accretion values > 0) are separated from non-events
 (model accretion value = 0).
 Then, in each neighborhood, the total proportion of events is calculated.
 In the leftmost panel, four events exist in the 25 point neighborhood,
 making the HiRA proportion is 4/25 = 0.16.
 For the neighborhood of size 9 centered in that same panel, the HiRA proportion
 is 1/9.
 In the right panel, the size 25 neighborhood has HiRA proportion of 6/25,
 with the centered 9-point neighborhood having a HiRA value of 2/9.
 To extend this method into 3-dimensions, all layers within the user-defined
 layer are also included in the calculation of the proportion in the same
 manner.

\begin_layout Standard
Often, the neighborhood size is chosen so that multiple models to be compared
 have approximately the same horizontal resolution.
 Then, standard metrics for probabilistic forecasts, such as Brier Score,
 can be used to compare those forecasts.
 HiRA was developed using surface observation stations so the neighborhood
 lies completely within the horizontal plane.
 With any type of upper air observation, the vertical neighborhood must
 also be defined.

The Point-Stat tool computes a wide variety of verification statistics.
 Broadly speaking, these statistics can be subdivided into statistics for
 categorical variables and statistics for continuous variables.
 The categories of measures are briefly described here; specific descriptions
 of the measures are provided in Appendix

Measures for categorical variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Categorical verification statistics are used to evaluate forecasts that
 are in the form of a discrete set of categories rather than on a continuous
 scale.
 If the original forecast is continuous, the user may specify one or more
 threhsolds in the configuration file to divide the continuous measure into
 categories.
 Currently, Point-Stat computes categorical statistics for variables in
 two or more categories.
 The special case of dichotomous (i.e., 2-category) variables has several
 types of statistics calculated from the resulting contingency table and
 are available in the CTS output line type.
 For multi-category variables, fewer statistics can be calculated so these
 are available separately, in line type MCTS.
 Categorical variables can be intrinsic (e.g., rain/no-rain) or they may be
 formed by applying one or more thresholds to a continuous variable (e.g.,
 temperature < 273.15 K or cloud coverage percentages in 10% bins).
 See Appendix

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

\bar under
Measures for continuous variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For continuous variables, many verification measures are based on the forecast
 error (i.e., f - o).
 However, it also is of interest to investigate characteristics of the forecasts
, and the observations, as well as their relationship.
 These concepts are consistent with the general framework for verification
 outlined by Murphy and Winkler (1987).
 The statistics produced by MET for continuous forecasts represent this
 philosophy of verification, which focuses on a variety of aspects of performanc
e rather than a single measure.
 See Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 for specific information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
A user may wish to eliminate certain values of the forecasts from the calculatio
n of statistics, a process referred to here as``'conditional verification''.
 For example, a user may eliminate all temperatures above freezing and then
 calculate the error statistics only for those forecasts of below freezing
 temperatures.
 Another common example involves verification of wind forecasts.
 Since wind direction is indeterminate at very low wind speeds, the user
 may wish to set a minimum wind speed threshold prior to calculating error
 statistics for wind direction.
 The user may specify these threhsolds in the configuration file to specify
 the conditional verification.
 Thresholds can be specified using the usual Fortran conventions (<, <=,
 ==, !-, >=, or >) followed by a numeric value.
 The threshold type may also be specified using two letter abbreviations
 (lt, le, eq, ne, ge, gt).
 Further, more complex thresholds can be achieved by defining multiple threshold
s and using && or || to string together event definition logic.
 The forecast and observation threshold can be used together according to
 user preference by specifying one of: UNION, INTERSECTION, or SYMDIFF (symmetri
c difference).

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

\bar under
Measures for probabilistic forecasts and dichotomous outcomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For probabilistic forecasts, many verification measures are based on reliability
, accuracy and bias.
 However, it also is of interest to investigate joint and conditional distributi
ons of the forecasts and the observations, as in Wilks (2011).
 See Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:App_C-Verification-Measures"

\end_inset

 for specific information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Probabilistic forecast values are assumed to have a range of either 0 to
 1 or 0 to 100.
 If the max data value is > 1, we assume the data range is 0 to 100, and
 divide all the values by 100.
 If the max data value is <= 1, then we use the values as is.
 Further, thresholds are applied to the probabilities with equality on the
 lower end.
 For example, with a forecast probability p, and thresholds t1 and t2, the
 range is defined as: t1 <= p < t2.
 The exception is for the highest set of thresholds, when the range includes
 1: t1 <= p <= 1.
 To make configuration easier, in METv6.0, these probabilities may be specfied
 in the configuration file as a list (>0.00,>0.25,>0.50,>0.75,>1.00) or using
 shorthand notation (==0.25) for bins of equal width.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In METv6.0, when the "prob" entry is set as a dictionary to define the field
 of interest, setting "prob_as_scalar = TRUE" indicates that this data should
 be processed as regular scalars rather than probabilities.For example, this
 option can be used to compute traditional 2x2 contingency tables and neighborho
od verification statistics for probability data.
 It can also be used to compare two probabilityfields directly.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For each of the types of statistics mentioned above (categorical, continuous,
 and probabilistic), it is possible to calculate mesures of skill relative
 to climatology.
 MET will accept a climatology file provided by the user, and will evaluate
 it as a reference forecast.
 Further, anomalies, i.e.
 departures from average conditions, can be calculated.
 As with all other statistics, the available measures will depend on the
 nature of the forecast.
 Common statistics that use a climatological reference include: the mean
 squared error skill score (MSESS), the Anomaly Correlation (ANOM_CORR),
 scalar and vector anomolies (SAL1L2 and VAL1L2), continuous ranked probability
 skill score (CRPSS), Brier Skill Score (BSS) (Wilks, 2011; Mason, 2004).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Often, the sample climatology is used as a reference by a skill score.
 The sample climatology is the average over all included observations and
 may be transparent to the user.
 This is the case in most categorical skill scores.
 The sample climatology will probably prove more difficult to improve upon
 than a long term climatology, since it will be from the same locations
 and time periods as the forecasts.
 This may mask legitimate forecast skill.
 However, a more general climatology, perhaps covering many years, is often
 easier to improve upon and is less likely to mask real forecast skill.

Statistical confidence intervals

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
A single summary score gives an indication of the forecast performance,
 but it is a single realization from a random process that neglects uncertainty
 in the score's estimate.
 That is, it is possible to obtain a good score, but it may be that the
 "good" score was achieved by chance and does not reflect the "true" score.
 Therefore, when interpreting results from a verification analysis, it is
 imperative to analyze the uncertainty in the realized scores.
 One good way to do this is to utilize confidence intervals.
 A confidence interval indicates that if the process were repeated many
 times, say 100, then the true score would fall within the interval

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For continuous fields (e.g., temperature), it is possible to estimate confidence
 intervals for some measures of forecast performance based on the assumption
 that the data, or their errors, are normally distributed.
 The Point-Stat tool computes confidence intervals for the following summary
 measures: forecast mean and standard deviation, observation mean and standard
 deviation, correlation, mean error, and the standard deviation of the error.
 In the case of the respective means, the central limit theorem suggests
 that the means are normally distributed, and this assumption leads to the
 usual 
\begin_inset ERT

 confidence intervals for the mean.
 For the standard deviations of each field, one must be careful to check
 that the field of interest is normally distributed, as this assumption
 is necessary for the interpretation of the resulting confidence intervals.
\end_layout

For the measures relating the two fields (i.e., mean error, correlation and
 standard deviation of the errors), confidence intervals are based on either
 the joint distributions of the two fields (e.g., with correlation) or on
 a function of the two fields.
 For the correlation, the underlying assumption is that the two fields follow
 a bivariate normal distribution.
 In the case of the mean error and the standard deviation of the mean error,
 the assumption is that the errors are normally distributed, which for continuou
s variables, is usually a reasonable assumption, even for the standard deviation
 of the errors.

\begin_layout Standard

Bootstrap confidence intervals for any verification statistic are available
 in MET.
 Bootstrapping is a nonparametric statistical method for estimating parameters
 and uncertainty information.
 The idea is to obtain a sample of the verification statistic(s) of interest
 (e.g., bias, ETS, etc.) so that inferences can be made from this sample.
 The assumption is that the original sample of matched forecast-observation
 pairs is representative of the population.
 Several replicated samples are taken with replacement from this set of
 forecast-observation pairs of variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature,
 etc.), and the statistic(s) are calculated for each replicate.
 That is, given a set of n forecast-observation pairs, we draw values at
 random from these pairs, allowing the same pair to be drawn more than once,
 and the statistic(s) is (are) calculated for each replicated sample.
 This yields a sample of the statistic(s) based solely on the data without
 making any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the sample.
 It should be noted, however, that if the observed sample of matched pairs
 is dependent, then this dependence should be taken into account somehow.
 Currently, in the confidence interval methods in MET do not take into account
 dependence, but future releases will support a robust method allowing for
 dependence in the original sample.
 More detailed information about the bootstrap algorithm is found in the
 appendix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Confidence intervals can be calculated from the sample of verification statistic
s obtained through the bootstrap algorithm.
 The most intuitive method is to simply take the appropriate quantiles of
 the sample of statistic(s).
 For example, if one wants a 95% CI, then one would take the 2.5 and 97.5
 percentiles of the resulting sample.
 This method is called the percentile method, and has some nice properties.
 However, if the original sample is biased and/or has non-constant variance,
 then it is well known that this interval is too optimistic.
 The most robust, accurate, and well-behaved way to obtain accurate CIs
 from bootstrapping is to use the bias corrected and adjusted percentile
 method (or BCa).
 If there is no bias, and the variance is constant, then this method will
 yield the usual percentile interval.
 The only drawback to the approach is that it is computationally intensive.
 Therefore, both the percentile and BCa methods are available in MET, with
 the considerably more efficient percentile method being the default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The only other option associated with bootstrapping currently available
 in MET is to obtain replicated samples smaller than the original sample
 (i.e., to sample 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$m<n$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 points at each replicate).
 Ordinarily, one should use 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$m=n$
\end_layout

\end_inset

, and this is the default.
 However, there are cases where it is more appropriate to use a smaller
 value of m (e.g., when making inference about high percentiles of the original
 sample).
 See Gilleland (2008) for more information and references about this topic.

 Setting the flag to BOTH indicates that the line type should be written
 to the STAT file as well as a separate ASCII file where the data is grouped
 by line type.
 The output flags correspond to the following output line types:

Note that writing out matched pair data (MPR lines) for a large number of
 cases is generally not recommended.
 The MPR lines create very large output files and are only intended for
 use on a small set of cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If all line types corresponding to a particular verificaiton method are
 set to NONE, the computation of those statistics will be skipped in the
 code and thus make the Point-Stat tool run more efficiently.
 For example, if FHO, CTC, and CTS are all set to NONE, the Point-Stat tool
 will skip the categorical verification step.

 produces output in STAT and, optionally, ASCII format.
 The ASCII output duplicates the STAT output but has the data organized
 by line type.
 The output files will be written to the default output directory or the
 directory specified using the "-outdir" command line option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The output STAT file will be named using the following naming convention:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 indicates the forecast valid time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The output ASCII files are named similarly: 
\end_layout
