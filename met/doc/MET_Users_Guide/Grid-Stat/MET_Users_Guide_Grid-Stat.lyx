The Grid-Stat tool provides verification statistics for a matched forecast
 and observation grid.
 All of the forecast grid points in the region of interest are matched to
 observation grid points on the same grid.
 All the matched grid points are used to compute the verification statistics.
 The Grid-Stat tool functions in much the same way as the Point-Stat tool,
 except that no interpolation is required because the forecasts and observations
 are on the same grid.
 However, the interpolation parameters may be used to perform a smoothing
 operation on the forecast and observation fields prior to verification.
 In addition to traditional verification approaches, the Grid-Stat tool
 includes neighborhood methods, designed to examine forecast performance
 as a function of spatial scale.

Scientific and statistical aspects of the Grid-Stat tool are briefly described
 in this chapter, followed by practical details regarding usage and output
 from the tool.

Statistical measures

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The Grid-Stat tool computes a wide variety of verification statistics.
 Broadly speaking, these statistics can be subdivided into three types of
 statistics: measures for categorical variables, measures for continuous
 variables, and measures for probabilistic forecasts.
 Further, when a climatology file is included, reference statistics for
 the forecasts compared to the climatology can be calculated.
 These categories of measures are briefly described here; specific descriptions
 of all measures are provided in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard

In addition to these verification measures, the Grid-Stat tool also computes
 partial sums and other FHO statistics that are produced by the NCEP verificatio
n system.
 These statistics are also described in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

\shape slanted
Measures for categorical variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Categorical verification statistics are used to evaluate forecasts that
 are in the form of a discrete set of categories rather than on a continuous
 scale.
 Grid-Stat computes both 2x2 and multi-category contingency tables and their
 associated statistics, similar to Point-Stat.
 See Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:App_C-Verification-Measures"

\end_inset

 for more information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Measures for continuous variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For continuous variables, many verification measures are based on the forecast
 error (i.e., f - o).
 However, it also is of interest to investigate characteristics of the forecasts
, and the observations, as well as their relationship.
 These concepts are consistent with the general framework for verification
 outlined by Murphy and Winkler (1987).
 The statistics produced by MET for continuous forecasts represent this
 philosophy of verification, which focuses on a variety of aspects of performanc
e rather than a single measure.
 See Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:App_C-Verification-Measures"

\end_inset

 for specific information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Measures for probabilistic forecasts and dichotomous outcomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For probabilistic forecasts, many verification measures are based on reliability
, accuracy and bias.
 However, it also is of interest to investigate joint and conditional distributi
ons of the forecasts and the observations, as in Wilks (2011).
 See Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:App_C-Verification-Measures"

\end_inset

 for specific information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
Probabilistic forecast values are assumed to have a range of either 0 to
 1 or 0 to 100.
 If the max data value is > 1, we assume the data range is 0 to 100, and
 divide all the values by 100.
 If the max data value is <= 1, then we use the values as is.
 Further, thresholds are applied to the probabilities with equality on the
 lower end.
 For example, with a forecast probability p, and thresholds t1 and t2, the
 range is defined as: t1 <= p < t2.
 The exception is for the highest set of thresholds, when the range includes
 1: t1 <= p <= 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Use of a climatology field for comparative verification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The Grid-Stat tool allows evaluation of model forecasts compared with a
 user-supplied climatology.
 Prior to calculation of statistics, the climatology must be put on the
 same grid as the forecasts and observations.
 In particular, the anomoly correlation and mean squared error skill score
 provide a measure of the forecast skill versus the climatology.
 For more details about climatological comparisons and reference forecasts,
 see the relevant section in the Point-Stat Chapter.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Use of analysis fields for verification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The Grid-Stat tool allows evaluation of model forecasts using model analysis
 fields.
 However, users are cautioned that an analysis field is not independent
 of its parent model; for this reason verification of model output using
 an analysis field from the same model is generally not recommended and
 is not likely to yield meaningful information about model performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Statistical confidence intervals
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:GS_Statistical-confidence-intervals"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The confidence intervals for the Grid-Stat tool are the same as those provided
 for the Point-Stat tool except that the scores are based on pairing grid
 points with grid points so that there are likely more values for each field
 making any assumptions based on the central limit theorem more likely to
 be valid.
 However, it should be noted that spatial (and temporal) correlations are
 not presently taken into account in the confidence interval calculations.
 Therefore, confidence intervals reported may be somewhat too narrow (e.g.,
 Efron 2007).
 See Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 for details regarding confidence intervals provided by MET.

\begin_layout Subsection
Neighborhood methods
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:GS_Neighborhood-methods"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
MET also incorporates several neighborhood methods to give credit to forecasts
 that are close to the observations, but not necessarily exactly matched
 up in space.
 Also referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fuzzy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 verification methods, these methods do not just compare a single forecast
 at each grid point to a single observation at each grid point; they compare
 the forecasts and observations in a neighborhood surrounding the point
 of interest.
 With the neighborhood method, the user chooses a distance within which
 the forecast event can fall from the observed event and still be considered
 a hit.
 In MET this is implemented by defining a square search window around each
 grid point.
 Within the search window, the number of observed events is compared to
 the number of forecast events.
 In this way, credit is given to forecasts that are close to the observations
 without requiring a strict match between forecasted events and observed
 events at any particular grid point.
 The neighborhood methods allow the user to see how forecast skill varies
 with neighborhood size and can help determine the smallest neighborhood
 size that can be used to give sufficiently accurate forecasts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
There are several ways to present the results of the neighborhood approaches,
 such as the Fractions Skill Score (FSS) or the Fractions Brier Score (FBS).
 These scores are presented in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:App_C-Verification-Measures"

\end_inset

.
 One can also simply up-scale the information on the forecast verification
 grid by smoothing or resampling within a specified neighborhood around
 each grid point and recalculate the traditional verification metrics on
 the coarser grid.
 The MET output includes traditional contingency table statistics for each
 threshold and neighborhood window size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The user must specify several parameters in the 
\series default
grid_stat
\series medium
 configuration file to utilize the neighborhood approach, such as the interpolat
ion method, size of the smoothing window, and required fraction of valid
 data points within the smoothing window.
 For FSS-specific results, the user must specify the size of the neighborhood
 window, the required fraction of valid data points within the window, and
 the fractional coverage threshold from which the contingency tables are
 defined.
 These parameters are described further in the practical information section
 below.

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
This section contains information about configuring and running the Grid-Stat
 tool.
 The Grid-Stat tool verifies gridded model data using gridded observations.
 The input gridded model and observation datasets must be in one of the
 MET supported file formats.
 The input model and observation datasets must be on a common grid.
 The gridded observation data may be a gridded analysis based on observations
 such as Stage II or Stage IV data for verifying accumulated precipitation,
 or a model analysis field may be used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The Grid-Stat tool provides the capability of verifying one or more model
 variables/levels using multiple thresholds for each model variable/level.
 The Grid-Stat tool performs no interpolation because the input model, observati
on, and climatology datasets must be on a common grid.
 MET will interpolate these files to a common grid if one is specified.
 The interpolation parameters may be used to perform a smoothing operation
 on the forecast field prior to verifying it to investigate how the scale
 of the forecast affects the verification statistics.
 The Grid-Stat tool computes a number of continuous statistics for the forecast
 minus observation differences, discrete statistics once the data have been
 thresholded, or statistics for probabilistic forecasts.
 All types of statistics can incorporate a climatological reference.

 All variables are treated as scalar quantities with the exception of the
 U and V components of the wind.
 When the U component is followed by the V component, both with the same

 Wind speed is typically not available in model files, but if it is, it
 will be used directly.
 However, if wind speed is unavailable but the U and V components of the

To indicate that a forecast field should be treated as probabilities, include
 the prob=TRUE indicator.
 Probability fields should contain values in the range [0, 1] or [0, 100].
 However, when MET encounters a probability field with a range [0, 100],
 it will automatically rescale it to be [0, 1] before applying the probabilistic
 verification methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
For each 
\series default
cat_thresh
\series medium
 listed above one or more thresholds must be specified for use in computing
 discrete statistics.
 The thresholds are specified using >, >=, ==, !=, <, or <=.
 Multiple thresholds may be applied to each field by providing a comma-separated
 list.
 The values listed above indicate that the field of 3-hourly accumulated
 precipitation will be thresholded greater than zero and greater than or
 equal to 5.0 mm.
 It is the user's responsibility to know the units for each model variable
 and to choose appropriate threshold values.
 For probabilistic forecasts, thresholds must be specified using >= convention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Adding a new masking polygon requires no code changes and no recompiling.
 Internally, the lat/lon polygon points are converted into x/y values in
 the grid.

Alternatively, any gridded data file that MET can read may be used to define
 a verification masking region.
 Users must specify a description of the field to be used from the input

 Any grid point where the resulting field is 0, the mask is turned off.
 Any grid point where it is non-zero, the mask is turned on.

\series medium
The 
\series default
ci_alpha
\series medium
 variable contains a comma-separated list of alpha values to be used when
 computing confidence intervals.
 The confidence interval computed is 1 minus the 
\series default
ci_alpha
\series medium
 value.
 The value of 0.05 listed above indicates that the 95th percentile confidence
 interval should be computed.
 Refer to Section

 for more information about confidence intervals and recommended values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
interval
\series medium
 variable indicates what method should be used for computing bootstrap confidenc
e intervals.
 A value of 
\series default
BCA
\series medium
 indicates that the highly accurate but computationally intensive BCa (bias-corr
ected percentile) method should be used.
 A value of 
\series default
PCTILE
\series medium
 indicates that the somewhat less accurate but efficient percentile method
 should be used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
rep_prop
\series medium
 variable must be set to a value between 0 and 1.
 When computing bootstrap confidence intervals over n sets of matched pairs,
 the size of the subsample, m, may be chosen less than or equal to the size
 of the sample, n.
 This variable defines the size of m as a proportion relative to the size
 of n.
 A value of 1, as shown above, indicates that the size of the subsample,
 m, should be equal to the size of the sample, n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
n_rep
\series medium
 variable defines the number of subsamples that should be taken when computing
 bootstrap confidence intervals.
 This variable should be set large enough so that when confidence intervals
 are computed multiple times for the same set of data, the intervals do
 not change much.
 Setting this variable to zero disables the computation of bootstrap confidence
 intervals that may be necessary to run in realtime or near-realtime over
 large domains.
 Setting this variable to 1000, indicates that bootstrap confidence interval
 should be computed over 1000 subsamples of the matched pairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
rng
\series medium
 variable defines the random number generator to be used in the computation
 of bootstrap confidence intervals.
 Subsamples are chosen at random from the full set of matched pairs.
 The randomness is determined by the random number generator specified.
 Users should refer to detailed documentation of the GNU Scientific Library
 for a listing of the random number generators available for use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
seed
\series medium
 variable may be set to a specific value to make the computation of bootstrap
 confidence intervals fully repeatable.
 When left empty, as shown above, the random number generator seed is chosen
 automatically which will lead to slightly different bootstrap confidence
 intervals being computed each time the data is run.
 Specifying a value here ensures that the bootstrap confidence intervals
 will be computed the same over multiple runs of the same data.

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The 
\series default
vld_thresh
\series medium
 variable contains a number between 0 and 1.
 When performing a smoothing operation over some neighborhood of points
 the ratio of the number of valid data points to the total number of points
 in the neighborhood is computed.
 If that ratio is greater than this threshold, a smoothed value is computed.
 Setting this threshold to 1, which is the default, requires that the entire
 neighborhood must contain valid data.
 This variable will typically come into play only along the boundaries of
 the verification region chosen.

The 
\series default
vld_thresh
\series medium
 variable contains a number between 0 and 1.
 When performing neighborhood verification over some neighborhood of points
 the ratio of the number of valid data points to the total number of points
 in the neighborhood is computed.
 If that ratio is greater than this threshold, that value is included in
 the neighborhood verification.
 Setting this threshold to 1, which is the default, requires that the entire
 neighborhood must contain valid data.
 This variable will typically come into play only along the boundaries of
 the verification region chosen.

\series medium
The 
\series default
cov_thresh
\series medium
 variable contains a comma separated list of thresholds to be applied to
 the neighborhood coverage field.
 The coverage is the proportion of forecast points in the neighborhood that
 exceed the forecast threshold.
 For example, if 10 of the 25 forecast grid points contain values larger
 than a threshold of 2, then the coverage is 10/25 = 0.4.
 If the coverage threshold is set to 0.5, then this neighborhood is considered
