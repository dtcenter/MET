////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The configuration files that control many of the MET tools contain formatted
ASCII text. This format has been updated for METv4.0 and continues to be used
in subsequent releases.

Settings common to multiple tools are described in the top part of this README
file and settings specific to individual tools are described beneath the common
settings. Please refer to the MET User's Guide in the "doc" directory for more
details about the settings if necessary.

A configuration file entry is an entry name, followed by an equal sign (=),
followed by an entry value, and is terminated by a semicolon (;). The
configuration file itself is one large dictionary consisting of entries, some of
which are dictionaries themselves.

The configuration file language supports the following data types:
   - Dictionary:
      - Grouping of one or more entries enclosed by curly braces {}.
   - Array:
      - List of one or more entries enclosed by square braces [].
      - Array elements are separated by commas.
   - String:
      - A character string enclosed by double quotation marks "".
   - Integer:
      - A numeric integer value.
   - Float:
      - A numeric float value.
   - Boolean:
      - A boolean value (TRUE or FALSE).
   - Threshold:
      - A threshold type (<, <=, ==, !-, >=, or >) followed by a numeric value.
      - The threshold type may also be specified using two letter abbreviations
        (lt, le, eq, ne, ge, gt).
      - Multiple thresholds may be combined by specifying the logic type of AND
        (&&) or OR (||). For example, ">=5&&<=10" defines the numbers between 5
        and 10 and "==1||==2" defines numbers exactly equal to 1 or 2.
   - Percentile Thresholds:
      - Thresholds may be defined as percentiles of the data being processed in
        several places:
         - In Point-Stat and Grid-Stat when setting "cat_thresh", "wind_thresh",
           and "cnt_thresh".
         - In Wavelet-Stat when setting "cat_thresh".
         - In MODE when setting "conv_thresh" and "merge_thresh".
         - In Ensemble-Stat when setting "obs_thresh".
         - When using the "censor_thresh" config option.
         - In the Stat-Analysis "-out_fcst_thresh" and "-out_obs_thresh" job
           command options.
         - In the Gen-Vx-Mask "-thresh" command line option.
      - The following percentile threshold types are supported:
         - "SFP" for a percentile of the sample forecast values.
           e.g. ">SFP50" means greater than the 50-th forecast percentile.
         - "SOP" for a percentile of the sample observation values.
           e.g. ">SOP75" means greater than the 75-th observation percentile.
         - "SCP" for a percentile of the sample climatology values.
           e.g. ">SCP90" means greater than the 90-th climatology percentile.
         - "USP" for a user-specified percentile threshold.
           e.g. "<USP90(2.5)" means less than the 90-th percentile values which
           the user has already determined to be 2.5 outside of MET.
         - "==FBIAS1" to automatically de-bias the data. This option must be
           used in conjunction with a simple threshold in the other field.
           For example, when "obs.cat_thresh = >5.0" and
           "fcst.cat_thresh = ==FBIAS1;", MET applies the >5.0 threshold to the
           observations and then chooses a forecast threshold which results in a
           frequency bias of 1.
         - "CDP" for climatological distribution percentile thresholds.
           These thresholds require that the climatological mean and standard
           deviation be defined using the climo_mean and climo_stdev config file
           options, respectively. The categorical (cat_thresh), conditional
           (cnt_thresh), or wind speed (wind_thresh) thresholds are defined
           relative to the climatological distribution at each point. Therefore,
           the actual numeric threshold applied can change for each point.
           e.g. ">CDP50" means greater than the 50-th percentile of the
           climatological distribution for each point.
      - When percentile thresholds of type SFP, SOP, SCP, or CDP are requested
        for continuous filtering thresholds (cnt_thresh), wind speed thresholds
        (wind_thresh), or observation filtering thresholds (obs_thresh in
        ensemble_stat), the following special logic is applied. Percentile
        thresholds of type equality are automatically converted to percentile
        bins which span the values from 0 to 100.
        For example, "==CDP25" is automatically expanded to 4 percentile bins:
           >=CDP0&&<CDP25,>=CDP25&&<CDP50,>=CDP50&&<CDP75,>=CDP75&&<=CDP100
      - When sample percentile thresholds of type SFP, SOP, SCP, or FBIAS1 are
        requested, MET recomputes the actual percentile that the threshold
        represents. If the requested percentile and actual percentile differ by
        more than 5%, a warning message is printed. This may occur when the
        sample size is small or the data values are not truly continuous.
      - When percentile thresholds of type SFP, SOP, SCP, or USP are used, the
        actual threshold value is appended to the FCST_THRESH and OBS_THRESH
        output columns. For example, if the 90-th percentile of the current set
        of forecast values is 3.5, then the requested threshold "<=SFP90" is
        written to the output as "<=SFP90(3.5)".
      - When parsing FCST_THRESH and OBS_THRESH columns, the Stat-Analysis tool
        ignores the actual percentile values listed in parentheses.
   - Piecewise-Linear Function (currently used only by MODE):
      - A list of (x, y) points enclosed in parenthesis ().
      - The (x, y) points are *NOT* separated by commas.
   - User-defined function of a single variable:
      - Left side is a function name followed by variable name in parenthesis.
      - Right side is an equation which includes basic math functions (+,-,*,/),
        built-in functions (listed below), or other user-defined functions.
      - Built-in functions include:
        sin, cos, tan, sind, cosd, tand, asin, acos, atan, asind, acosd, atand,
        atan2, atan2d, arg, argd, log, exp, log10, exp10, sqrt, abs, min, max,
        mod, floor, ceil, step, nint, sign

The context of a configuration entry matters. If an entry cannot be found in
the expected dictionary, the MET tools recursively search for that entry in the
parent dictionaries, all the way up to the top-level configuration file
dictionary. If you'd like to apply the same setting across all cases, you can
simply specify it once at the top-level. Alternatively, you can specify a
setting at the appropriate dictionary level to have finer control over the
behavior.

In order to make the configuration files more readable, several descriptive
integer types have been defined in the ConfigConstants file. These integer
names may be used on the right-hand side for many configuration file entries.

Each of the configurable MET tools expects a certain set of configuration
entries. Examples of the MET configuration files can be found in data/config
and scripts/config.

When you pass a configuration file to a MET tool, the tool actually parses up
to four different configuration files in the following order:
   (1) Reads share/met/config/ConfigConstants to define constants.
   (2) If the tool produces PostScript output, it reads
       share/met/config/ConfigMapData to define the map data to be plotted.
   (3) Reads the default configuration file for the tool from share/met/config.
   (4) Reads the user-specified configuration file from the command line.

Many of the entries from step (3) are overwritten by the user-specified entries
from step (4). Therefore, the configuration file you pass in on the command
line really only needs to contain entries that differ from the defaults.

Any of the configuration entries may be overwritten by the user-specified
configuration file. For example, the map data to be plotted may be included in
the user-specified configuration file and override the default settings defined
in the share/met/config/ConfigMapData file.

The configuration file language supports the use of environment variables. They
are specified as ${ENV_VAR}, where ENV_VAR is the name of the environment
variable. When scripting up many calls to the MET tools, you may find it
convenient to use them. For example, when applying the same configuration to
the output from multiple models, consider defining the model name as an
environment variable which the controlling script sets prior to verifying the
output of each model. Setting MODEL to that environment variable enables you
to use one configuration file rather than maintianing many very similar ones.

An error in the syntax of a configuration file will result in an error from the
MET tool stating the location of the parsing error.

The MET_BASE variable is defined in the code at compilation time as the path
to the MET shared data. These are things like the default configuration files,
common polygons and color scales. MET_BASE may be used in the MET configuration
files when specifying paths and the appropriate path will be substituted in.
If MET_BASE is defined as an environment variable, its value will be used
instead of the one defined at compilation time.

The MET_OBS_ERROR_TABLE environment variable can be set to specify the location
of an ASCII file defining observation error information. The default table can
be found in the installed share/met/table_files/obs_error_table.txt. This
observation error logic is applied in Ensemble-Stat to perturb ensemble member
values and/or define observation bias corrections.

When processing point and gridded observations, Ensemble-Stat searches the table
to find the entry defining the observation error information. The table
consists of 15 columns and includes a header row defining each column. The
special string "ALL" is interpreted as a wildcard in these files. The first 6
columns (OBS_VAR, MESSAGE_TYPE, PB_REPORT_TYPE, IN_REPORT_TYPE, INSTRUMENT_TYPE,
and STATION_ID) may be set to a comma-separated list of strings to be matched.
In addition, the strings in the OBS_VAR column are interpreted as regular
expressions when searching for a match. For example, setting the OBS_VAR column
to 'APCP_[0-9]+' would match observations for both APCP_03 and APCP_24. The
HGT_RANGE, VAL_RANGE, and PRS_RANGE columns should either be set to "ALL" or
"BEG,END" where BEG and END specify the range of values to be used. The
INST_BIAS_SCALE and INST_BIAS_OFFSET columns define instrument bias adjustments
which are applied to the observation values. The DIST_TYPE and DIST_PARM
columns define the distribution from which random perturbations should be drawn
and applied to the ensemble member values. See the obs_error description below
for details on the supported error distributions. The last two columns, MIN and
MAX, define the bounds for the valid range of the bias-corrected observation
values and randomly perturbed ensemble member values. Values less than MIN are
reset to the mimumum value and values greater than MAX are reset to the maximum
value. A value of NA indicates that the variable is unbounded.

The MET_GRIB_TABLES environment variable can be set to specify the location of
custom GRIB tables. It can either be set to a specific file name or to a
directory containing custom GRIB tables files. These file names must begin with
a "grib1" or "grib2" prefix and end with a ".txt" suffix. Their format must
match the format used by the default MET GRIB table files, described below.
The custom GRIB tables are read prior to the default tables and their settings
take precedence.

At runtime, the MET tools read default GRIB tables from the installed
share/met/table_files directory, and their file formats are described below:

GRIB1 table files begin with "grib1" prefix and end with a ".txt" suffix.
The first line of the file must contain "GRIB1".
The following lines consist of 4 integers followed by 3 strings:
Column 1: GRIB code (e.g. 11 for temperature)
Column 2: parameter table version number
Column 3: center id (e.g. 07 for US Weather Service- National Met. Center)
Column 4: subcenter id
Column 5: variable name
Column 6: variable description
Column 7: units

GRIB2 table files begin with "grib2" prefix and end with a ".txt" suffix.
The first line of the file must contain "GRIB2".
The following lines consist of 8 integers followed by 3 strings.

column 9:  variable name
column 10: variable description
column 11: units

//      - to_grid = "G218"; To regrid both to a named grid.
//      - to_grid = "path"; To regrid both to a grid defined by a file.
//      - to_grid = "spec"; To define a grid specified as follows:

//      a ratio of the number of valid data points to the total number of
//      points in the neighborhood. If that ratio is less than this threshold,
//      write bad data for the current point.
//
//   - The "method" entry defines the regridding method to be used.
//      - Valid regridding methods:
//         - MIN         for the minimum value

//                       as long as the grid x and y dimensions match.
//         - UPPER_LEFT  for the upper left grid point (width = 1)
//         - UPPER_RIGHT for the upper right grid point (width = 1)
//         - LOWER_RIGHT for the lower right grid point (width = 1)
//         - LOWER_LEFT  for the lower left grid point (width = 1)

//
//         The BEST and GEOG_MATCH interpolation options are not valid for
//         regridding.
//
//   - The "width" entry specifies a regridding width, when applicable.
//      - width = 4;     To regrid using a 4x4 box or circle with diameter 4.
//
//   - The "shape" entry defines the shape of the neighborhood.
//     Valid values are "SQUARE" or "CIRCLE"
//
//   - The "gaussian_dx" entry specifies a delta distance for Gaussian

//
//   - The "gaussian_radius" entry defines the radius of influence for Gaussian
//     smoothing. The default is 120. Ignored if not Gaussian method.
//
//   - The "gaussian_dx" and "gaussian_radius" settings must be in the same
//     units, such as kilometers or degress.  Their ratio

//
// The "fcst" entry is a dictionary containing information about the field(s)
// to be verified. This dictionary may include the following entries:
//
//   - The "field" entry is an array of dictionaries, each specifying a
//     verification task. Each of these dictionaries may include:
//
//      - The "name" entry specifies a name for the field.
//
//      - The "level" entry specifies level information for the field.
//
//      - Setting "name" and "level" is file-format specific. See below.
//
//      - The "prob" entry in the forecast dictionary defines probability
//        information. It may either be set as a boolean (i.e. TRUE or FALSE)
//        or as a dictionary defining probabilistic field information.
//
//        When set as a boolean to TRUE, it indicates that the "fcst.field" data
//        should be treated as probabilities. For example, when verifying the
//        probabilistic NetCDF output of Ensemble-Stat, one could configure the
//        Grid-Stat or Point-Stat tools as follows:
//
//           fcst = {
//              field = [ { name  = "APCP_24_A24_ENS_FREQ_gt0.0";
//                          level = "(*,*)";
//                          prob  = TRUE; } ];
//           }
//
//        Setting "prob = TRUE" indicates that the "APCP_24_A24_ENS_FREQ_gt0.0"
//        data should be processed as probabilities.
//
//        When set as a dictionary, it defines the probabilistic field to be
//        used. For example, when verifying GRIB files containing probabilistic
//        data,  one could configure the Grid-Stat or Point-Stat tools as
//        follows:
//
//           fcst = {
//              field = [ { name = "PROB"; level = "A24";
//                          prob = { name = "APCP"; thresh_lo = 2.54; } },
//                        { name = "PROB"; level = "P850";
//                          prob = { name = "TMP"; thresh_hi = 273; } } ];
//           }
//
//        The example above selects two probabilistic fields. In both, "name"
//        is set to "PROB", the GRIB abbreviation for probabilities. The "level"
//        entry defines the level information (i.e. "A24" for a 24-hour
//        accumulation and "P850" for 850mb). The "prob" dictionary defines the
//        event for which the probability is defined. The "thresh_lo"
//        (i.e. APCP > 2.54) and/or "thresh_hi" (i.e. TMP < 273) entries are
//        used to define the event threshold(s).
//
//        Probability fields should contain values in the range
//        [0, 1] or [0, 100]. However, when MET encounters a probability field
//        with a range [0, 100], it will automatically rescale it to be [0, 1]
//        before applying the probabilistic verification methods.
//
//      - Set "prob_as_scalar = TRUE" to override the processing of probability
//        data. When the "prob" entry is set as a dictionary to define the
//        field of interest, setting "prob_as_scalar = TRUE" indicates that this
//        data should be processed as regular scalars rather than probabilities.
//        For example, this option can be used to compute traditional 2x2
//        contingency tables and neighborhood verification statistics for
//        probability data. It can also be used to compare two probability
//        fields directly. When this flag is set, probability values are
//        automatically rescaled from the range [0, 100] to [0, 1].
//
//      - The "convert" entry is a user-defined function of a single variable
//        for processing input data values. Any input values that are not bad
//        data are replaced by the value of this function. The convert function
//        is applied prior to regridding or thresholding. This function may
//        include any of the built-in math functions (e.g. sqrt, log10)
//        described above.
//        Several standard unit conversion functions are already defined in
//        data/config/ConfigConstants.
//        Examples of user-defined conversion functions include:
//          convert(x) = 2*x;
//          convert(x) = x^2;
//          convert(a) = log10(a);
//          convert(a) = a^10;
//          convert(t) = max(1, sqrt(abs(t)));
//          convert(x) = K_to_C(x); where K_to_C(x) is defined in
//                                  ConfigConstants
//
//      - The "censor_thresh" entry is an array of thresholds to be applied
//        to the input data. The "censor_val" entry is an array of numbers
//        and must be the same length as "censor_thresh". These arguments must
//        appear together in the correct format (threshold and number). For each
//        censor threshold, any input values meeting the threshold criteria will
//        be reset to the corresponding censor value. An empty list indicates
//        that no censoring should be performed. The censoring logic is applied
//        prior to any regridding but after the convert function. All statistics
//        are computed on the censored data. These entries may be used to apply
//        quality control logic by resetting data outside of an expected range
//        to the bad data value of -9999. These entries are not indicated in the
//        metadata of any output files, but the user can set the "desc" entry
//        accordingly.
//
//      Examples of user-defined conversion functions include:
//          censor_thresh = [ >12000 ];
//          censor_val    = [ 12000 ];
//
//      - Several configuration options are provided to override and correct the
//        metadata read from the input file. The supported options are listed
//        below:
//
//        // Data attributes
//        set_attr_name      = "string";
//        set_attr_level     = "string";
//        set_attr_units     = "string";
//        set_attr_long_name = "string";
//
//        // Time attributes
//        set_attr_init  = "YYYYMMDD[_HH[MMSS]]";
//        set_attr_valid = "YYYYMMDD[_HH[MMSS]]";
//        set_attr_lead  = "HH[MMSS]";
//        set_attr_accum = "HH[MMSS]";
//
//        // Grid definition (must match the actual data dimensions)
//        set_attr_grid  = "named grid or grid specification string";
//
//        // Flags
//        is_precipitation     = boolean;
//        is_specific_humidity = boolean;
//        is_u_wind            = boolean;
//        is_v_wind            = boolean;
//        is_grid_relative     = boolean;
//        is_wind_speed        = boolean;
//        is_wind_direction    = boolean;
//        is_prob              = boolean;
//
//      - The "cat_thresh" entry is an array of thresholds to be used when
//        computing categorical statistics.
//
//      - The "cnt_thresh" entry is an array of thresholds for filtering
//        data prior to computing continuous statistics and partial sums.
//
//      - The "cnt_logic" entry may be set to UNION, INTERSECTION, or SYMDIFF
//        and controls the logic for how the forecast and observed cnt_thresh
//        settings are combined when filtering matched pairs of forecast and
//        observed values.
//
//   - The "file_type" entry specifies the input gridded data file type rather
//     than letting the code determine it. MET determines the file type by
//     checking for known suffixes and examining the file contents. Use this
//     option to override the code's choice. The valid file_type values are
//     listed the "data/config/ConfigConstants" file and are described below.
//     This entry should be defined within the "fcst" and/or "obs" dictionaries.
//     e.g.
//     fcst = {
//        file_type = GRIB1;         // GRIB version 1
//        file_type = GRIB2;         // GRIB version 2
//        file_type = NETCDF_MET;    // NetCDF created by another MET tool
//        file_type = NETCDF_PINT;   // NetCDF created by running the p_interp
//                                   // or wrf_interp utility on WRF output.
//                                   // May be used to read unstaggered raw WRF
//                                   // NetCDF output at the surface or a
//                                   // single model level.
//        file_type = NETCDF_NCCF;   // NetCDF following the Climate Forecast
//                                   // (CF) convention.
//        file_type = PYTHON_NUMPY;  // Run a Python script to load data into
//                                   // a NumPy array.
//        file_type = PYTHON_XARRAY; // Run a Python script to load data into
//                                   // an xarray object.
//     }
//
//   - The "wind_thresh" entry is an array of thresholds used to filter wind
//     speed values when computing VL1L2 vector partial sums. Only those U/V
//     pairs that meet this wind speed criteria will be included in the sums.
//     Setting this threshold to NA will result in all U/V pairs being used.
//
//   - The "wind_logic" entry may be set to UNION, INTERSECTION, or SYMDIFF
//     and controls the logic for how the forecast and observed wind_thresh
//     settings are combined when filtering matched pairs of forecast and
//     observed wind speeds.
//
//   - The "eclv_points" entry specifies the economic cost/loss ratio points
//     to be evaluated. For each cost/loss ratio specified, the relative value
//     will be computed and written to the ECLV output line. This entry may
//     either be specified as an array of numbers between 0 and 1 or as a single
//     number. For an array, each array entry will be evaluated. For a single
//     number, all evenly spaced points between 0 and 1 will be evaluated, where
//     eclv_points defines the spacing. Cost/loss values are omitted for
//     ratios of 0.0 and 1.0 since they are undefined.
//
//   - The "init_time" entry specifies the initialization time in
//     YYYYMMDD[_HH[MMSS]]
//     format. This entry can be included in the "fcst" entry as shown below or
//     included in the "field" entry if the user would like to use different
//     initialization times for different fields.
//
//   - The "valid_time" entry specifies the valid time in YYYYMMDD[_HH[MMSS]]
//     format. This entry can be included in the "fcst" entry as shown below or
//     included in the "field" entry if the user would like to use different
//     valid times for different fields.
//
//   - The "lead_time" entry specifies the lead time in HH[MMSS]
//     format. This entry can be included in the "fcst" entry as shown below or
//     included in the "field" entry if the user would like to use different
//     lead times for different fields.
//
// It is only necessary to use the "init_time", "valid_time", and/or "lead_time"
// settings when verifying a file containing data for multiple output times.
// For example, to verify a GRIB file containing data for many lead times, you
// could use "lead_time" to specify the record to be verified.
//
// File-format specific settings for the "field" entry:
//
//    - GRIB1 and GRIB2:
//       - For custom GRIB tables, see note about MET_GRIB_TABLES.
//       - The "name" entry specifies a GRIB code number or abbreviation.
//         - GRIB1 Product Definition Section:

//          - ANNN for accumulation interval NNN
//          - ZNNN for vertical level NNN
//          - ZNNN-NNN for a range of vertical levels
//          - PNNN for pressure level NNN in hPa
//          - PNNN-NNN for a range of pressure levels in hPa
//          - LNNN for a generic level type
//          - RNNN for a specific GRIB record number
//       - The "GRIB_lvl_typ" entry is an integer specifying the level type.
//       - The "GRIB_lvl_val1" and "GRIB_lvl_val2" entries are floats specifying
//         the first and second level values.
//       - The "GRIB_ens" entry is a string specifying NCEP's usage of the
//         extended PDS for ensembles. Set to "hi_res_ctl", "low_res_ctl",
//         "+n", or "-n", for the n-th ensemble member.
//       - The "GRIB1_ptv" entry is an integer specifying the GRIB1 parameter
//         table version number.
//       - The "GRIB1_code" entry is an integer specifying the GRIB1 code (wgrib
//         kpds5 value).
//       - The "GRIB1_center" is an integer specifying the originating center.
//       - The "GRIB1_subcenter" is an integer specifying the originating
//         subcenter.

//       - The "GRIB2_ltab" is an integer specifying the local table number.
//       - The "GRIB2_disc" is an integer specifying the GRIB2 discipline code.

//       - The "GRIB2_cntr" is an integer specifying the originating center.
//       - The "GRIB2_ens_type" is an integer specifying the ensemble type
//         (Table 4.6).
//       - The "GRIB2_der_type" is an integer specifying the derived product
//         type (Table 4.7).
//       - The "GRIB2_stat_type" is an integer specifying the statistical

//       - The "GRIB2_ipdtmpl_index" and "GRIB2_ipdtmpl_val" entries are arrays
//         of integers which specify the product description template values to
//         be used. The indices are 0-based. For example, use the following to
//         request a GRIB2 record whose 9-th and 27-th product description
//         template values are 1 and 2, respectively:
//            GRIB2_ipdtmpl_index=[8, 26]; GRIB2_ipdtmpl_val=[1, 2];
//
//    - NetCDF (from MET tools, CF-compliant, p_interp, and wrf_interp):
//       - The "name" entry specifies the NetCDF variable name.
//       - The "level" entry specifies the dimensions to be used:
//          - (i,...,j,*,*) for a single field, where i,...,j specifies fixed
//            dimension values and *,* specifies the two dimensions for the
//            gridded field.
//       e.g.
//           field = [
//             {
//               name       = "QVAPOR";
//               level      = "(0,5,*,*)";
//             },

//               level      = [ "(*,*)" ];
//             }
//
//           ];
//
//    - Python (using PYTHON_NUMPY or PYTHON_XARRAY):
//       - The Python interface for MET is described in Appendix F of the MET
//         User's Guide.
//       - Two methods for specifying the Python command and input file name
//         are supported. For tools which read a single gridded forecast and/or
//         observation file, both options work. However, only the second option
//         is supported for tools which read multiple gridded data files, such
//         as Ensemble-Stat, Series-Analysis, and MTD.
//
//       Option 1:
//          - On the command line, replace the path to the input gridded data
//            file with the constant string PYTHON_NUMPY or PYTHON_XARRAY.
//          - Specify the configuration "name" entry as the Python command to be
//            executed to read the data.
//          - The "level" entry is not required for Python.
//          e.g.
//             field = [
//               { name = "read_ascii_numpy.py data/python/fcst.txt FCST"; }
//             ];
//
//       Option 2:
//          - On the command line, leave the path to the input gridded data
//            as is.
//          - Set the configuration "file_type" entry to the constant
//            PYTHON_NUMPY or PYTHON_XARRAY.
//          - Specify the configuration "name" entry as the Python command to be
//            executed to read the data, but replace the input gridded data file
//            with the constant MET_PYTHON_INPUT_ARG.
//          - The "level" entry is not required for Python.
//          e.g.
//             file_type = PYTHON_NUMPY;
//             field     = [
//               { name = "read_ascii_numpy.py MET_PYTHON_INPUT_ARG FCST"; }
//             ];

}

//
// The "obs" entry specifies the same type of information as "fcst", but for
// the observation data. It will often be set to the same things as "fcst",
// as shown in the example below. However, when comparing forecast and
// observation files of different format types, this entry will need to be set
// in a non-trivial way. The length of the "obs.field" array must match the
// length of the "fcst.field" array.
//     e.g.
//         obs = fcst;

//     or
//
//         fcst = {

//
//
//   - The "message_type" entry is an array of point observation message types
//     to be used. This only applies to the tools that verify against point
//     observations. This may be specified once at the top-level "obs"
//     dictionary or separately for each "field" array element. In the example
//     shown above, this is specified in the "fcst" dictionary and copied to
//     "obs".
//
//   - Simplified vertical level matching logic is applied for surface message
//     types. Observations for the following message types are assumed to be at
//     the surface, as defined by the default message_type_group_map:
//        ADPSFC, SFCSHP, MSONET
//
//   - The "message_type" would be placed in the "field" array element if more
//     than one "message_type" entry is desired within the config file.
//     e.g.
//     fcst = {
//       censor_thresh = [];
//       censor_val    = [];
//       cnt_thresh    = [ NA ];
//       cnt_logic     = UNION;
//       wind_thresh   = [ NA ];
//       wind_logic    = UNION;
//
//       field = [
//          {

//          }
//       ];
//     }
//
//    - The "sid_inc" entry is an array of station ID groups indicating which
//      station ID's should be included in the verification task. If specified,
//      only those station ID's appearing in the list will be included.  Note
//      that filtering by station ID may also be accomplished using the "mask.sid"
//      option. However, when using the "sid_inc" option, statistics are reported
//      separately for each masking region.
//    - The "sid_exc" entry is an array of station ID groups indicating which
//      station ID's should be excluded from the verification task.
//    - Each element in the "sid_inc" and "sid_exc" arrays is either the name of
//      a single station ID or the full path to a station ID group file name.
//      A station ID group file consists of a name for the group followed by a
//      list of station ID's. All of the station ID's indicated will be concatenated
//      into one long list of station ID's to be included or excluded.
//    - As with "message_type" above, the "sid_inc" and "sid_exc" settings can be
//      placed in the in the "field" array element to control which station ID's
//      are included or excluded for each verification task.
//
obs = fcst;

//
// The "climo_mean" dictionary specifies climatology mean data to be read by the
// Grid-Stat, Point-Stat, Ensemble-Stat, and Series-Analysis tools. It consists
// of several entires defining the climatology file names and fields to be used.
//
//   - The "file_names" entry specifies one or more file names containing
//     the gridded climatology data to be used.
//
//   - The "field" entry is an array of dictionaries, specified the same
//     way as those in the "fcst" and "obs" dictionaries. If the array has

//     statistics will be written as missing data. Otherwise, the array
//     length must match the length of "field" in the "fcst" and "obs"
//     dictionaries.
//
//   - The "regrid" dictionary defines how the climatology data should be
//     regridded to the verification domain.
//
//   - The "time_interp_method" entry specifies how the climatology data should
//     be interpolated in time to the forecast valid time:
//      - NEAREST for data closest in time
//      - UW_MEAN for average of data before and after
//      - DW_MEAN for linear interpolation in time of data before and after
//
//   - The "day_interval" entry is an integer specifying the spacing in days of
//     the climatology data. Use 31 for monthly data or 1 for daily data.
//     Use "NA" if the timing of the climatology data should not be checked.
//
//   - The "hour_interval" entry is an integer specifying the spacing in hours of
//     the climatology data for each day. This should be set between 0 and 24,
//     with 6 and 12 being common choices. Use "NA" if the timing of the
//     climatology data should not be checked.
//
//   - The "day_interval" and "hour_interval" entries replace the deprecated
//     entries "match_month", "match_day", and "time_step".

// The "climo_stdev" dictionary specifies climatology standard deviation data to
// be read by the Grid-Stat, Point-Stat, Ensemble-Stat, and Series-Analysis
// tools. The "climo_mean" and "climo_stdev" data define the climatological
// distribution for each grid point, assuming normality. These climatological
// distributions are used in two ways:
// (1) To define climatological distribution percentile (CDP) thresholds which
//     can be used as categorical (cat_thresh), continuous (cnt_thresh), or wind
//     speed (wind_thresh) thresholds.
// (2) To subset matched pairs into climatological bins based on where the
//     observation value falls within the climatological distribution. See the
//     "climo_cdf" dictionary.
//
// This dictionary is identical to the "climo_mean" dictionary described above
// but points to files containing climatological standard deviation values
// rather than means. In the example below, this dictionary is set by copying
// over the "climo_mean" setting and then updating the "file_name" entry.

//
// The "climo_cdf" dictionary specifies how the the climatological mean
// ("climo_mean") and standard deviation ("climo_stdev") data are used to
// evaluate model performance relative to where the observation value falls
// within the climatological distribution. This dictionary consists of 3
// entries:
// (1) The "cdf_bins" entry defines the climatological bins either as an integer
//     or an array of floats between 0 and 1.
// (2) The "center_bins" entry may be set to TRUE or FALSE.
// (3) The "write_bins" entry may be set to TRUE or FALSE.
//
// MET uses the climatological mean and standard deviation to construct a normal
// PDF at each observation location. The total area under the PDF is 1, and the
// climatological CDF value is computed as the area of the PDF to the left of
// the observation value. Since the CDF is a value between 0 and 1, the CDF
// bins must span that same range.
//
// When "cdf_bins" is set to an array of floats, they explicitly define the
// climatological bins. The array must begin with 0.0 and end with 1.0.
// For example:
//   cdf_bins = [ 0.0, 0.10, 0.25, 0.75, 0.90, 1.0 ];
//
// When "cdf_bins" is set to an integer, it defines the number of bins to be
// used. The "center_bins" flag indicates whether or not the bins should be
// centered on 0.5. An odd number of bins can be centered or uncentered while
// an even number of bins can only be  uncentered. For example:
//   4 uncentered bins (cdf_bins = 4; center_bins = FALSE;) yields:
//     0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0
//   5 uncentered bins (cdf_bins = 5; center_bins = FALSE;) yields:
//     0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0
//   5   centered bins (cdf_bins = 5; center_bins = TRUE;) yields:
//     0.0, 0.125, 0.375, 0.625, 0.875, 1.0
//
// When multiple climatological bins are used, statistics are computed
// separately for each bin, and the average of the statistics across those bins
// is written to the output. When "write_bins" is true, the statistics for each
// bin are also written to the output. The bin number is appended to the
// contents of the VX_MASK output column.
//
// Setting the number of bins to 1 effectively disables this logic by grouping
// all pairs into a single climatological bin.
//
climo_cdf = {
   cdf_bins    = 11;    // or an array of floats

// When specifying climatology data for probability forecasts, either supply a
// probabilistic "climo_mean" field or non-probabilistic "climo_mean" and
// "climo_stdev" fields from which a normal approximation of the climatological
// probabilities should be derived.
//
// When "climo_mean" is set to a probability field with a range of [0, 1] and
// "climo_stdev" is unset, the MET tools use the "climo_mean" probability values
// directly to compute Brier Skill Score (BSS).
//
// When "climo_mean" and "climo_stdev" are both set to non-probability fields,
// the MET tools use the mean, standard deviation, and observation event
// threshold to derive a normal approximation of the climatological
// probabilities. Those derived probability values are used to compute BSS.
//

// The "mask_missing_flag" entry specifies how missing data should be handled
// in the Wavelet-Stat and MODE tools:
//    - "NONE" to perform no masking of missing data
//    - "FCST" to mask the forecast field with missing observation data
//    - "OBS" to mask the observation field with missing forecast data
//    - "BOTH" to mask both fields with missing data from the other
//
mask_missing_flag = BOTH;

//
// The "obs_window" entry is a dictionary specifying a beginning ("beg"
// entry) and ending ("end" entry) time offset values in seconds. It defines
// the time window over which observations are retained for scoring. These time
// offsets are defined relative to a reference time t, as [t+beg, t+end].
// In PB2NC, the reference time is the PREPBUFR files center time. In
// Point-Stat and Ensemble-Stat, the reference time is the forecast valid time.

obs_window = {
   beg = -5400;
   end =  5400;
}

//
// The "mask" entry is a dictionary that specifies the verification masking
// regions to be used when computing statistics. Each mask defines a
// geographic extent, and any matched pairs falling inside that area will be
// used in the computation of statistics. Masking regions may be specified
// in the following ways:
//
//    - The "grid" entry is an array of named grids. It contains a
//      comma-separated list of pre-defined NCEP grids over which to perform
//      verification. An empty list indicates that no masking grids should be
//      used. The standard NCEP grids are named "GNNN" where NNN indicates the
//      three digit grid number. Supplying a value of "FULL" indicates that the
//      verification should be performed over the entire grid on which the data
//      resides.
//      http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/on388/tableb.html
//      The "grid" entry can be the gridded data file defining grid.
//
//    - The "poly" entry contains a comma-separated list of files that define
//      verification masking regions. These masking regions may be specified in
//      two ways: as a lat/lon polygon or using a gridded data file such as the
//      NetCDF output of the Gen-Vx-Mask tool.
//
//       - An ASCII file containing a lat/lon polygon.
//         Latitude in degrees north and longitude in degrees east.
//         The first and last polygon points are connected.
//         e.g. "MET_BASE/poly/EAST.poly" which consists of n points:
//              "poly_name lat1 lon1 lat2 lon2... latn lonn"
//
//         Several masking polygons used by NCEP are predefined in the
//         installed share/met/poly directory. Creating a new polygon is as
//         simple as creating a text file with a name for the polygon followed
//         by the lat/lon points which define its boundary. Adding a new masking
//         polygon requires no code changes and no recompiling. Internally, the
//         lat/lon polygon points are converted into x/y values in the grid. The
//         lat/lon values for the observation points are also converted into x/y
//         grid coordinates. The computations performed to check whether the
//         observation point falls within the polygon defined is done in x/y
//         grid space.
//
//       - The NetCDF output of the gen_vx_mask tool.
//
//       - Any gridded data file that MET can read may be used to define a
//         verification masking region. Users must specify a description of the
//         field to be used from the input file and, optionally, may specify a
//         threshold to be applied to that field. Once this threshold is
//         applied, any grid point where the resulting field is 0, the mask is
//         turned off. Any grid point where it is non-zero, the mask is turned
//         on.
//         e.g. "sample.grib {name = \"TMP\"; level = \"Z2\";} >273"
//
//    - The "sid" entry is an array of strings which define groups of
//      observation station ID's over which to compute statistics. Each entry
//      in the array is either a filename of a comma-separated list.
//       - For a filename, the strings are whitespace-separated. The first
//         string is the mask "name" and the remaining strings are the station
//         ID's to be used.
//       - For a comma-separated list, optionally use a colon to specify a name.
//         For "MY_LIST:SID1,SID2", name = MY_LIST and values = SID1 and SID2.
//       - For a comma-separated list of length one with no name specified, the
//         mask "name" and value are both set to the single station ID string.
//         For "SID1", name = SID1 and value = SID1.
//       - For a comma-separated list of length greater than one with no name
//         specified, the name is set to MASK_SID and the values are the station
//         ID's to be used.
//         For "SID1,SID2", name = MASK_SID and values = SID1 and SID2.
//       - The "name" of the station ID mask is written to the VX_MASK column
//         of the MET output files.
//    - The "llpnt" entry is either a single dictionary or an array of
//      dictionaries. Each dictionary contains three entries, the "name" for
//      the masking region, "lat_thresh", and "lon_thresh". The latitude and
//      longitude thresholds are applied directly to the point observation
//      latitude and longitude values. Only observations whose latitude and
//      longitude values meet this threshold criteria are used. A threshold set
//      to "NA" always evaluates to true.
//
// The masking logic for processing point observations in Point-Stat and
// Ensemble-Stat fall into two cateogries. The "sid" and "llpnt" options apply
// directly to the point observations. Only those observations for the specified
// station id's are included in the "sid" masks. Only those observations meeting
// the latitude and longitude threshold criteria are included in the "llpnt"
// masks.
//
// The "grid" and "poly" mask options are applied to the grid points of the
// verification domain. Each grid point is determined to be inside or outside
// the masking region. When processing point observations, their latitude and
// longitude values are rounded to the nearest grid point of the verification
// domain. If the nearest grid point is inside the mask, that point observation
// is included in the mask.

//
// The "ci_alpha" entry is an array of floats specifying the values for alpha
// to be used when computing confidence intervals. Values of alpha must be

// value. Therefore, an alpha value of 0.05 corresponds to a 95% confidence
// interval.
//
ci_alpha = [ 0.05, 0.10 ];

//
// The "boot" entry defines the parameters to be used in calculation of
// bootstrap confidence intervals. The interval variable indicates what method
// should be used for computing bootstrap confidence intervals:
//
//    - The "interval" entry specifies the confidence interval method:
//       - "BCA" for the BCa (bias-corrected percentile) interval method is
//         highly accurate but computationally intensive.
//       - "PCTILE" uses the percentile method which is somewhat less accurate
//         but more efficient.
//
//    - The "rep_prop" entry specifies a proportion between 0 and 1 to define
//      the replicate sample size to be used when computing percentile
//      intervals. The replicate sample size is set to boot_rep_prop * n,
//      where n is the number of raw data points.
//
//      When computing bootstrap confidence intervals over n sets of matched
//      pairs, the size of the subsample, m, may be chosen less than or equal to
//      the size of the sample, n. This variable defines the size of m as a
//      proportion relative to the size of n. A value of 1 indicates that the
//      size of the subsample, m, should be equal to the size of the sample, n.
//
//    - The "n_rep" entry defines the number of subsamples that should be taken
//      when computing bootstrap confidence intervals. This variable should be
//      set large enough so that when confidence intervals are computed multiple
//      times for the same set of data, the intervals do not change much.
//      Setting this variable to zero disables the computation of bootstrap
//      confidence intervals, which may be necessary to run MET in realtime or
//      near-realtime over large domains since bootstrapping is computationally
//      expensive. Setting this variable to 1000 indicates that bootstrap
//      confidence interval should be computed over 1000 subsamples of the
//      matched pairs.
//
//    - The "rng" entry defines the random number generator to be used in the
//      computation of bootstrap confidence intervals. Subsamples are chosen at
//      random from the full set of matched pairs. The randomness is determined
//      by the random number generator specified. Users should refer to detailed
//      documentation of the GNU Scientific Library for a listing of the random
//      number generators available for use.
//      http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/
//      Random-Number-Generator-Performance.html
//
//    - The "seed" entry may be set to a specific value to make the computation
//      of bootstrap confidence intervals fully repeatable. When left empty
//      the random number generator seed is chosen automatically which will lead
//      to slightly different bootstrap confidence intervals being computed each
//      time the data is run. Specifying a value here ensures that the bootstrap
//      confidence intervals will be reproducable over multiple runs on the same
//      computing platform.

//
// The "interp" entry is a dictionary that specifies what interpolation or
// smoothing (for the Grid-Stat tool) methods should be applied.
// This dictionary may include the following entries:
//
//    - The "field" entry specifies to which field(s) the interpolation method
//      should be applied. This does not apply when doing point verification
//      with the Point-Stat or Ensemble-Stat tools:
//       - "FCST" to interpolate/smooth the forecast field.
//       - "OBS" to interpolate/smooth the observation field.
//       - "BOTH" to interpolate/smooth both the forecast and the observation.
//
//    - The "vld_thresh" entry specifies a number between 0 and 1. When
//      performing interpolation over some neighborhood of points the ratio of
//      the number of valid data points to the total number of points in the
//      neighborhood is computed. If that ratio is less than this threshold,
//      the matched pair is discarded. Setting this threshold to 1, which is the
//      default, requires that the entire neighborhood must contain valid data.
//      This variable will typically come into play only along the boundaries of
//      the verification region chosen.
//
//    - The "shape" entry may be set to SQUARE or CIRCLE to specify the shape
//      of the smoothing area.
//
//    - The "type" entry is an array of dictionaries, each specifying an
//      interpolation method. Interpolation is performed over a N by N box
//      centered on each point, where N is the width specified. Each of these
//      dictionaries must include:
//
//      - The "width" entry is an integer which specifies the size of the
//        interpolation area. The area is either a square or circle containing
//        the observation point. The width value specifies the width of the
//        square or diameter of the circle. A width value of 1 is interpreted
//        as the nearest neighbor model grid point to the observation point.
//        For squares, a width of 2 defines a 2 x 2 box of grid points around
//        the observation point (the 4 closest model grid points), while a width
//        of 3 defines a 3 x 3 box of grid points around the observation point,
//        and so on. For odd widths in grid-to-point comparisons
//        (i.e. Point-Stat), the interpolation area is centered on the model
//        grid point closest to the observation point. For grid-to-grid
//        comparisons (i.e. Grid-Stat), the width must be odd.
//
//      - The "method" entry specifies the interpolation procedure to be
//        applied to the points in the box:
//         - MIN         for the minimum value
//         - MAX         for the maximum value
//         - MEDIAN      for the median value
//         - UW_MEAN     for the unweighted average value
//         - DW_MEAN     for the distance-weighted average value
//                         where weight = distance^-2
//         - LS_FIT      for a least-squares fit
//         - BILIN       for bilinear interpolation (width = 2)
//         - NEAREST     for the nearest grid point (width = 1)
//         - BEST        for the value closest to the observation
//         - UPPER_LEFT  for the upper left grid point (width = 1)
//         - UPPER_RIGHT for the upper right grid point (width = 1)
//         - LOWER_RIGHT for the lower right grid point (width = 1)
//         - LOWER_LEFT  for the lower left grid point (width = 1)
//         - GAUSSIAN    for the Gaussian kernel
//         - MAXGAUSS    for the maximum value followed by a Gaussian smoother
//         - GEOG_MATCH  for the nearest grid point where the land/sea mask
//                          and geography criteria are satisfied.
//
//         The BUDGET, FORCE, GAUSSIAN, and MAXGAUSS methods are not valid for
//         interpolating to point locations. For grid-to-grid comparisons, the

//      statistics are calculated. Users who have computed fractional
//      coverage fields outside of MET can use this option to disable

// the ensemble continuous statistics (ECNT) and ranked probability score (RPS)
// line types are computed directly from the ensemble values. Second, for each
// categorical threshold specified, a fractional coverage value is computed as

//          index is computed using two models, a forecast model and a
//          reference model. For each statistic in the index, a skill score
//          is computed as:
//             SS = 1 - (S[model]*S[model])/(S[reference]*S[reference])
//          Where S is the statistic.
//          Next, a weighted average is computed over all the skill scores.
//          Lastly, an index value is computed as:
//             Index = sqrt(1/(1-SS[avg]))
//          Where SS[avg] is the weighted average of skill scores.
//          Required Args:

//                                 including the .stat header columns. Multiple
//                                 values for each header column are written as
//                                 a comma-separated list.
//       "-set_hdr col_name value" may be used multiple times to explicity

//                                 columns of the output .stat file.
//
//   When using the "-by" job command option, you may reference those columns
//   in the "-set_hdr" job command options. For example, when computing statistics
//   separately for each station, write the station ID string to the VX_MASK column
//   of the output .stat output file:
//     -job aggregate_stat -line_type MPR -out_line_type CNT \
//     -by OBS_SID -set_hdr VX_MASK OBS_SID -stat_out out.stat
//   When using mulitple "-by" options, use "CASE" to reference the full string:
//     -by FCST_VAR,OBS_SID -set_hdr DESC CASE -stat_out out.stat
