How to compile and run?
-----------------------

For more detailed instructions on building MET and for a list of supported
platforms and compilers, please refer to the MET User's Guide in the doc/
sub-directory, or the MET Online Tutorial:
  http://www.dtcenter.org/met/users/support/online_tutorial

- Set the $CXX and $F77 environment variables to specify the C++ and FORTRAN
  compilers to be used.  If not set, configure will search for compilers and the
  ones if finds may or may not be compatible with those used to compile the
  needed third party libraries.

- If compiling on a big endian machine set the $CXXFLAGS environment variable to
  include '-DBIGENDIAN'.

- Set environment variables to point to the locations of the needed third party
  libraries.  For each library, there are three possible environment variables.
  If the library is installed in one location with an "include" subdirectory
  containing the include files and a "lib" directory containing the library
  files, the $MET_<lib> environment should be set to point to that main
  directory. If the include and library files files are installed in any other
  way, the $MET_<lib>INC and $MET_<lib>INC environment variables should both be
  set, with $MET_<lib>INC pointing to the directory with the include files and
  $MET_<lib>LIB pointing to the directory with the library files.  If
  $MET_<lib>INC and $MET_<lib>LIB are defined, then $MET_<lib> is ignored.

   - Set $MET_NETCDF to point to the main NetCDF directory, or set
     $MET_NETCDFINC to point to the directory with the NetCDF include files
     and set $MET_NETCDFLIB to point to the directory with the NetCDF
     library files.

   - Set $MET_HDF5 to point to the main HDF5 directory.

   - Set $MET_BUFR to point to the main BUFR directory, or set $MET_BUFRLIB
     to point to the directory with the BUFR library files.  Because we don't
     use any BUFR library include files, you don't need to specify
     $MET_BUFRINC.

   - Set $MET_GSL to point to the main GSL directory, or set $MET_GSLINC to
     point to the directory with the GSL include files and set $MET_GSLLIB
     to point to the directory with the GSL library files.

   - If compiling support for GRIB2, set $MET_GRIB2CINC and $MET_GRIB2CLIB
     to point to the main GRIB2C directory which contains both the include
     and library files.  These are used instead of $MET_GRIB2C since the main
     GRIB2C directory does not contain include and lib subdirectories.

   - If compiling support for PYTHON, set $MET_PYTHON_CC and $MET_PYTHON_LD
     to specify the compiler (-I) and linker (-L) flags required for python.
     Set $MET_PYTHON_CC for the directory containing the "Python.h" header file,
     which is the output of running 'python-config --cflags'.
     Set $MET_PYTHON_LD for the directory containing the python library file
     and indicate the library file names, which is the output of running
     'python-config --ldflags'.
     For example:
     MET_PYTHON_CC=`python-config --cflags`
     MET_PYTHON_LD=`python-config --ldflags`
     For more information about Python support in MET, please refer to Appendix
     F of the MET User's Guide.

   - If compiling MODIS-Regrid, set $MET_HDF to point to the main HDF directory,
     or set $MET_HDFINC to point to the directory with the HDF include files
     and set $MET_HDFLIB to point to the directory with the HDF library files.
     Also, set $MET_HDFEOS to point to the main HDF EOS directory, or set
     $MET_HDFEOSINC to point to the directory with the HDF EOS include files
     and set $MET_HDFEOSLIB to point to the directory with the HDF EOS library
     files.

   - If compiling MODE Graphics, set $MET_CAIRO to point to the main Cairo
     directory, or set $MET_CAIROINC to point to the directory with the Cairo
     include files and set $MET_CAIROLIB to point to the directory with the
     Cairo library files. Also, set $MET_FREETYPE to point to the main FreeType
     directory, or set $MET_FREETYPEINC to point to the directory with the
     FreeType include files and set $MET_FREETYPELIB to point to the directory
     with the FreeType library files.

   - When running MODE Graphics, set $MET_FONT_DIR to the directory containing
     font data required at runtime.  A link to the tarball containing this font
     data can be found on the downloads page of the MET website.

- Configure the installation for your system using the configure script.  The
  configure script has command line options to specify where to install MET and
  which MET utilities to install.  Type "./configure --help" for a detailed list
  of options, including the following:

  --prefix=PREFIX
      By default, MET will install all the files in "/usr/local/bin".  You can
      specify an installation prefix other than "/usr/local" using "--prefix",
      for instance "--prefix=$HOME" or "--prefix=`pwd`".

  --enable and --disable options for each of the MET tools.

  By default, compilation of GRIB2 support, Python support, the MODIS-Regrid
  tool, the Lidar2NC tool,and MODE-Graphics are disabled.
  Use the following options to enable them:

  --enable-grib2
      Enable compilation of utilities using GRIB2
      Requires $MET_GRIB2C

  --enable-python
      Enable compilation of python interface
      Requires $MET_PYTHON_CC and $MET_PYTHON_LD

  --enable-modis
      Enable compilation of modis
      Requires $MET_HDF and $MET_HDFEOS

  --enable-mode_graphics
      Enable compilation of mode_graphics
      Requires $MET_CAIRO, $MET_FREETYPE, and $MET_FONT_DIR

  --enable-lidar2nc
      Enable compilation of lidar2nc
      Requires $MET_HDF

  To configure MET to install all of the available tools in the "bin"
  subdirectory of your current directory, you would use the following command:

  ./configure --prefix=`pwd` --enable-grib2 --enable-python \
              --enable-modis --enable-mode_graphics --enable-lidar2nc

- Type 'make install >& make_install.log &'

- Type 'tail -f make_install.log' to view the execution of the make.

- When make is finished, type 'CNTRL-C' to quit the tail.

- If all tools are enabled and the build is successful, the "<prefix>/bin"
  directory (where <prefix> is the prefix you specified on your configure
  command line) will contain 31 executables:
   - ascii2nc
   - ensemble_stat
   - gen_vx_mask
   - grid_stat
   - gis_dump_dbf
   - gis_dump_shp
   - gis_dump_shx
   - gsid2mpr
   - gsidens2orank
   - lidar2nc
   - madis2nc
   - mode
   - mode_analysis
   - modis_regrid
   - mtd
   - pb2nc
   - pcp_combine
   - plot_data_plane
   - plot_mode_field
   - plot_point_obs
   - point_stat
   - regrid_data_plane
   - series_analysis
   - shift_data_plane
   - stat_analysis
   - tc_dland
   - tc_pairs
   - tc_stat
   - wavelet_stat
   - wwmca_plot
   - wwmca_regrid

- Type 'ls <prefix>/bin' to check for the presence of the executables.

- Type 'make test >& make_test.log &' to run all of the test scripts in the
  directory.  These test scripts use test data supplied with the tarball.  For
  instructions on running your own data, please refer to the MET User's Guide.

- Type 'tail -f make_test.log' to view the execution of the test script.

- When the test script is finished, type 'CNTRL-C' to quit the tail.

- Look in "out" to find the output files for these tests.

- In particular, check that the PB2NC tool ran without error.  If there was an
  error, run "make clean" then rerun your configure command adding
  "--disable-block4" to your configure command line and rebuild MET.

   - Fortify is a static code analyzer tool which identifies potential security
     vulnerabilities.  Scanned the MET code base with Fortify and restructured
     it to address all high priority Fortify issues.
   - Common Libraries
      - Added support for defining thresholds as percentiles of data (see the
        user's guide for details and examples).
      - Added support for the Gaussian interpolation and regridding method,
        including the sigma option to define the shape.
      - Updated the embedded python logic so that a failures result in a warning
        instead of an error.
      - Enhanced the NetCDF library to request data using a timestring
        instead of requiring an explicit index for the time dimension.
      - Enhanced the NetCDF library to handle a wider variety of data types.
      - Added support for specifying the "file_type" option when parsing the
        "poly" configuration setting.

        the current values of the "-by" columns.  For example, the following job
        sets the output VX_MASK column to each observation station name found:
        -job aggregate_stat -line_type MPR -out_line_type CNT -by OBS_SID
        -set_hdr VX_MASK OBS_SID -out_stat mpr_to_cnt_by_sid.stat

Version 8.0 Release Notes:
-------------------------

- What's New:
   - Major Enhancements: python embedding, observation error logic, shapefiles
     for masking regions, point observation format overhaul, and rotated lat/lon
     projections
   - New Tools: Added three new utilities to dump shapefile information
     (gis_dump_dbf, gis_dump_shp, and gis_dump_shx)

- Changes to Output Formats:
   - Added new Ensemble Continuous Statistics line type (ECNT) for Ensemble-Stat
     and Point-Stat HiRA.
   - Removed CRPS, IGN, CRPSS, and SPREAD columns from the RHIST line type and
     move them to the new ECNT line type.
   - Added ENS_MEAN_OERR, SPREAD_OERR, SPREAD_PLUS_OERR columns to the ORANK
     line type.
   - Added ASPECT_DIFF and CURVATURE_RATIO columns to the MODE output.

- Enhancements to Existing Tools:
   - Distributed the latest set of bugfixes (details not listed here).
   - Removed many compilation warnings.
   - Python Embedding
      - Enhanced the MET tools to read gridded data by calling a Python script
        which loads data and metadata into a NumPy object.
      - Note that users must configure MET using "--enable-python" to enable
        this functionality.
      - Example "scripts/python" and "data/python" directories are now included.
      - See Appendix F of the MET User's Guide for more information.
   - Common Libraries
      - Added support for Rotated Lat/Lon projections.
      - Updated the MRMS GRIB2 table.
   - Point Pre-Processing Tools
      - Made a major change to the NetCDF point observation format written by
        PB2NC, ASCII2NC, MADIS2NC, and LIDAR2NC.  Data are now split out into
        multiple 1-dimensional arrays.  Created "table" variables to store
        unique strings and, for each observation, to store the indices for those
        tables.
      - Updated the NetCDF point observation format by replacing the UNLIMITED
        dimension with a fixed dimension, resulting in smaller file sizes.
   - Multiple Tools
      - For the statistics tools, changed the default config file "output_flag"
        settings from BOTH to NONE.
      - For climatologies, added the "match_month" flag to the "climo_mean" and
        "climo_stdev" config file dictionaries.  Setting "match_month" to FALSE
        now enable the use of persistence to define the climatology.
      - Added support for area-weighted (AW_MEAN) regridding logic.
      - Enhanced the ASCII2NC, MADIS2NC, PB2NC, STAT-Analysis, TC-Pairs, and
        TC-STAT to support the "mask.poly" config file option or "-mask_poly"
        command line option to process masking regions consistently across all
        the MET tools. They can now process the output of the Gen-Vx-Mask tool.
      - Enabled "vld_thresh = 0" in Ensemble-Stat and Series-Analysis config
        files.
      - Switched from using double precision to booleans for storing mask fields
        in Point-Stat, Grid-Stat, Ensemble-Stat, Wavelet-Stat, and
        Series-Analysis. When processing many masking regions, this will run
        faster and consume less memory.
      - Enhanced the logic for finding matching UGRD/VGRD verification tasks
        in Point-Stat and Grid-Stat to make it more robust.
   - Gen-Vx-Mask
      - Added support for the using shapefiles to define masking regions with
        the "-type shape" option.
   - Regrid-Data-Plane
      - Added the capability to read GOES-16 AOD data using the new "-coord" and
        "-qc" command line options.
   - ASCII2NC
      - Added support for the AERONET version 3 point observation format.
      - Added support for longer observation variable names.
   - PB2NC
      - Enhanced the output to include the PrepBufr values for report type,
        input report type, and instrument type for use in the observation error
        table lookup.
      - Fixed the computation of valid time for AIRNOW observations.
      - Added special handling for ANOWPM message types.
      - Rounded timestamps to the nearest second instead of truncating.
      - Enhanced the "-nmsg" command line option to be specified as the exact
        number of messages to be processed (e.g. -nmsg 25) or as a percentage
        of the messages (e.g. -nmsg 25%).
   - Time Summaries
      - Time summaries are now computed across multiple input files for ASCII2NC
        and PB2NC.
      - Enhanced the "time_summary" config file option by adding a "raw_data"
        flag to control whether the raw input values are written or only the
        time summary values.
      - Generalized the "time_summary.width" config file option to an integer
        for centered time windows (existing) or a dictionary with begin and end
        time offsets for uncentered windows (new).
   - Grid-Stat
      - Fixed the very slow computation of neighborhood methods fractional
        coverage fields introduced in met-7.0 when supporting circular
        neighborhoods.  (This was also posted as a bugfix for met-7.0.)
      - Fixed a memory allocation issue, leading to faster run times.
   - Point-Stat
      - The ECNT line type is now computed when applying the HiRA methodology,

        - Redefined config file options landfall _beg and landfall_end as
          timestring in HH[MMSS] format rather than an integer number of
          seconds, but make it backward compatible.  Interpret integers as
          seconds and strings as timestrings.
        - Add support for reading and filtering extra columns of data at the end
          of the input ASCII files.

          -out_fcst_wind_thresh and -out_obs_wind_thresh.
        - Add -column_thresh job command option to be consistent with other
          tools, but retain -column_min, -column_max, and -column_eq for
          backward compatibility.
    - PCP-Combine
        - Rename -varname command line option to -name to be consistent with
          other MET tools.
        - Rename -config command line option to -field to be consistent with

          filtering thresholds should be applied.
    - Climatology Data
        - Add support for reading climatology data to Point-Stat, Grid-Stat,
          Ensemble-Stat, and Series-Analysis.
        - Add climo_mean dictionary to the config files for these tools to

          an error and returning of bad status.
        - Add output_precision option to specify the number of non-zero decimal
          places to be written to ASCII output files.
    - File I/O Changes
        - Improved logic when writing large unixtime values to NetCDF files.
          Write them as strings rather than integers, which caused integer
          overflow.
        - Better handling of timing information and lat/lon dimensions from
          CF-compliant NetCDF files.
        - When writing gridded NetCDF output, write lat/lon variables for
          lat/lon grids as 1-dimensional.  For all other projection types,
          continue writing 2-dimensional lat/lon variables.
        - Add obtype configuration entry to Grid-Stat, Ensemble-Stat,
          Wavelet-Stat, MODE, and Series-Analysis.  It's string value is written
          to the output files.

          (CLIMO).
        - RHIST: Add column for continuous ranked probability skill score
          (CRPSS).
        - TCMPR: Add 16 columns for the ADECK and BDECK values for RADP, RRP,
          MRD, GUSTS, EYE, DIR, SPEED, and DEPTH.

Version 5.0 Release Notes:
-------------------------

- What's New:
   - METv5.0 includes a major overhaul of the build process, the

       - Fixed bug in MODE where object intensity percentiles were only being
         computed over values greater than zero, rather than the full range.
       - Fixed bug in pcp_combine -varname option that was preventing the use
         of underscores in the output variable name.
       - Enhanced TC-Pairs to refine interpretation of zeros as bad data in
         many of the input ATCF columns.
       - Enhanced MADIS2NC by adding support for mesonet datasets.
       - Refined logic in TC-Pairs when computing consensus tracks by ensuring
         that the required members are present at each lead time.
       - Major overhaul of the TC-Dland tool to compute global distances to land
         rather than being limited to the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins.
         Add a global 1/10th degree distance to land data file to the release.
       - Enhanced STAT-Analysis by adding support for an aggregate_stat job type
         conversion of MPR to WDIR that reads UGRD and VGRD matched pair lines
         and computes aggregated wind direction errors.  Added
         -out_fcst_wind_thresh and -out_obs_wind_thresh options to filter the
         U/V pairs by wind speed prior to computing wind direction errors.
    - Added new output statistics:
       - Enhanced the SL1L2 and SAL1L2 line types from Point-Stat and Grid-Stat
         by adding the mean absolute error (MAE), enabling MAE to be aggregated
         across multiple cases.
       - Enhanced the CNT line type from Point-Stat and Grid-Stat by adding the
         inter-quartile range of the error (EIQR) and the median absolute
         deviation (MAD).
       - Enhanced the CTS line type from Point-Stat and Grid-Stat by adding the
         log odds ratio (LODDS), odds ratio skill score (ORSS), extreme
         dependency score (EDS), symmetric EDS (SEDS), extreme dependency index
         (EDI), symmetric EDI (SEDI), and the bias-adjusted Gilbert skill score
         (BAGSS).
       - Enhanced the NBRCNT line type from Grid-Stat by adding the asymptotic
         fractions skill score (AFSS), uniform fractions skill score (UFSS), and
         the forecast and observation rates (F_RATE and O_RATE).
       - Enhanced the MPR line type from Point-Stat and the ORANK line type from
         Ensemble-Stat by adding the observation quality flag value.
       - Enhanced Ensemble-Stat by adding the probability integral transform
         histogram (PHIST) line type.
       - Enhanced STAT-Analysis to aggregate and recompute all the new
         statistics listed above.
    - Added new command line and configuration options:
       - Enhanced Point-Stat and Ensemble-Stat by adding a station id exclusion,
         sid_exc, option to the configuration file to easily discard specific
         stations known to contain bad data.
         See met-5.0/data/config/README for details.
       - Enhanced ASCII2NC and MADIS2NC by adding the -mask_poly and -mask_grid
         command line options to filter the point observations spatially.
       - Enhanced STAT-Analysis to support comma-separated lists of values on
         the command line rather than using the same command line switch
         multiple times.
       - Enhanced the configuration files for MODE, Grid-Stat, and Wavelet-Stat
         to allow the user to select which fields should be included in the
         gridded NetCDF output.
         See met-5.0/data/config/README for details.
       - Enhanced ASCII2NC by adding a message_type_map entry to the
         configuration file which defines a mapping of input little_R report
         types to output message types.  Previously this mapping had been hard
         coded and any changes required recompiling.
       - Enhanced MODE by adding a shift_right entry to configuration file to
         shift a global grid by some number of grid points.  This enables the
         user to define the location of the longitude cut line for global grids.
       - Enhanced TC-Pairs by refining the interp12 configuration option.
         See met-5.0/data/config/README_TC for details.
       - Enhanced TC-Stat by adding an event_equal_lead configuration option
         to list specific lead times that must be present for a track to be
         included in the event equalization logic.

       - Enhanced support for reading TRMM NetCDF data from these sources:
         http://gdata1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/G3/gui.cgi?instance_id=TRMM_3-Hourly
         http://gdata1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/G3/gui.cgi?instance_id=TRMM_3B42_Daily
       - Enhanced MET's handling of NetCDF files by reading and applying the
         FillValue and/or missing_value variable attributes when parsing gridded
         data.
       - Enhanced STAT-Analysis and MODE-Analysis to include column headers in
         the output file specified with the -dump_row option.
       - Enhanced the NetCDF output of MODE by adding convex hull polyline
         points.
       - Add the model name as a global attribute to the NetCDF output of
         Grid-Stat, Wavelet-Stat, Ensemble-Stat, MODE, and Series-Analysis.
       - Reduced the file size of the PostScript files generated by the MET
         tools by adding zlib compression.
       - Enhanced the MODE PostScript files by placing the data into tables.
       - Right-justify all numeric output columns in the ASCII output of MET.
       - Update the GRIB1 and GRIB2 table definitions:
         http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/on388
         http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/grib2/grib2_doc.shtml

Version 4.1 Release Notes:
-------------------------

- What's New:
    - METv4.1 includes several new tools and enhancements:
      - New Tools: MODIS-Regrid, Series-Analysis, and MET-Tropical Cyclone
      - Major Enhancments: Spread-Skill Variance (SSVAR) for Ensemble-Stat

- New Tools:
    - The new MODIS-Regrid tool reformats gridded MODIS data for use by other
      MET tools.  Building MODIS-Regrid requires the HDF and HDF-EOS libraries.
    - The new Series-Analysis tool performs a grid-to-grid comparison over a
      series of fields, most commonly a time-series.  A user-specified set of
      statistics are computed over that series for each grid point and are
      written to a gridded NetCDF output file.  This tool may be used to analyze
      how model performance varies spatially.
    - The new set of MET-Tropical Cyclone (MET-TC) tools performs verification
      on ATCF (Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting) files.  The tools compare
      forecast ATCF files to the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) BEST track
      data.  MET-TC implements and extends the verification logic used by the
      NHC. See the MET-TC user's guide in the doc sub-directory for more detail.
      MET-TC consists of 3 tools:
      - TC-DLand precomputes distances to land and writes a gridded NetCDF file.
      - TC-Pairs matches the forecast and observation tracks and writes a
        Tropical Cyclone Statistics (.tcst) file.
      - TC-Stat reads .tcst files and computes summary statistics.
      - R-script (scripts/Rscripts/plot_tcmpr.R) for filtering and plotting
        the .tcst files.

- Enhancements to Existing Tools:
    - Distributed latest set of bug fixes for METv4.0.
    - Fixed two major bugs in MODE:
      - The object areas being reported were artificially inflated.
        See explanation:
          http://www.dtcenter.org/met/users/docs/write_ups/mode_areas.pdf
      - Areas of bad data were being treated as zero's in the convolution step.
    - Restructured the MODE code to make it more extensible.
    - Enhanced Point-Stat and Ensemble-Stat rejection reason counts to include
      the duplicate flag logic.
    - Enhanced ASCII2NC by adding support for the little_R point observation
      format.
    - Enhanced ASCII2NC by adding support for the SURFRAD point observation
      format, including time-averaging logic.
    - Enhanced MADIS2NC to support PROFILER and MARITIME data file types.
    - Enhanced Plot-Point-Obs by adding the -dot_size option.
    - Enhanced PB2NC, MADIS2NC, and ASCII2NC to pass through the point
      observation quality control flags and enhanced Point-Stat and
      Ensemble-Stat to filter the observations by those quality control values.
    - Enhanced Point-Stat and Ensemble-Stat by modifying the logic for the
      "mask_sid" entry in the configuration file.  It now contains a list of
      station ID's to be treated as a group.
    - Enhanced the duplicate flag logic in Point-Stat and Ensemble-Stat when
      verifying vertical level fields (e.g. 2-m temperature) against surface
      message type (e.g. ADPSFC or SFCSHP).  Set the observation level value to
      bad data so that different level values will not be treated as unique
      observations.
    - Enhanced Ensemble-Stat by adding the new SSVAR (spread-skill variance)
      output line type for creating ensemble spread-skill plots.
    - Enhanced STAT-Analysis to aggregate multiple SSVAR lines.
    - Enhanced STAT-Analysis by adding the "-by case" option for running jobs
      once for each unique case entry.
    - Factored map plotting information into data/config/ConfigMapData.  Users
      may specify which maps should be used when the MET tools create plots.

Version 4.0 Release Notes:
-------------------------

- What's New:
    - Users will notice two major upgrades for METv4.0:
      support for GRIB2 and a restructuring of the MET configuration files.

- Major Upgrades:
    - Added optional support for GRIB2.  This support depends on the external
      NCEP GRIB2 C-library.  Support for GRIB2 is enabled by setting the
      "WITH_GRIB2" flag in "user_defs.mk".
    - Restructured the MET configuration files to make them more readable and
      give the user finer control over the verification tasks to be performed.
      See "data/config/README" for more detail on the changes.

- Enhancements to Existing Tools:
    - Distributed latest set of bug fixes for METv3.1.
    - Enhanced Point-Stat and Ensemble-Stat to apply filtering logic when
      encountering duplicate point observations at the same location.  See the
      "duplicate_flag" section in "data/config/README" for more detail.
    - Enhanced PCP-Combine to run on all supported gridded data file types,
      rather than just GRIB1.  Added -config command line option to specify the
      field to be processed.
    - Enhanced STAT-Analysis and MODE-Analysis by adding support for the
      -fcst_valid_hour and -obs_valid_hour filtering options.
    - Enhanced STAT-Analysis to aggregate multiple NBRCNT lines together for the
      "aggregate" job type.
    - Enhanced handling of GRIB1 and GRIB2 table information by reading it from
      data files at runtime rather than having it hard-coded in header files.
    - For Point-Stat, Grid-Stat, Wavelet-Stat, Ensemble-Stat, and MODE, moved
      support for the -fcst_valid, -fcst_lead, -obs_valid, and -obs_lead
      filtering options from the command line to the configuration files.
    - Updated the WWMCA tools to ensure that pixel age masking is optional.
    - Fixed STAT-Analysis bug in the computation of the GO Index.
    - Fixed Ensemble-Stat bug in the handling of missing data.
    - Fixed library code bug when applying polyline masks to global datasets.

- Enhancement to the Build Process:
    - Defined unit tests for each of the MET tools and major library
      functionality.  These tests are not distributed with the code but are
      routinely run during development to ensure that new development does not
      break existing functionality.

Version 3.1 Release Notes:
-------------------------

- What's New:
    - The majority of the changes for METv3.1 are internal restructuring and
      streamlining of how MET reads gridded data, which should be transparent
      to the user. However, there have been several enhancements the typical
      user may notice. Please refer to the MET User's Guide for more detail on
      these additions.

- Major Upgrades:
    - Implemented a new data class hierarchy for reading gridded data files to
      enable future support of additional data formats, such as GRIB2.
    - Incorporated a new logger class throughout MET causing all messages
      printed to the screen to be prefixed with a message type of ERROR,
      WARNING, or DEBUG(N), where N indicates the debug level (default is 2):
        0: Suppress all messages except WARNING and ERROR.
        1: List input and output files.
        2: List summary processing information.
        3: List detailed processing information.
        4+: List detailed debugging information.
    - Added a -log command line option to all the MET tools to optionally
      write their output to a log file.
    - Changed how MET is storing gridded data from using an integer scale and
      offset to a double. The integer scale and offset approach used in prior
      versions of MET caused individual gridded data values to be stored using
      only five significant digits.
        - Comparing previous versions to METv3.1, users should notice only
          slight differences in the continuous statistics MET produces (CNT
          and SL1L2 line types).
        - However, users may notice more significant differences in statistics
          that are based on defining a threshold. Due to these precision issues,
          the contingency tables counts and statistics (CTC and CTS line types)
          MET produces may change significantly in METv3.1.
        - METv3.1 has enhanced precision over earlier versions and more
          accurately represents the input data and resulting statistical
          measures.

- New Tools:
    - Added new madis2nc tool to reformat MADIS NetCDF point observation files
      into a NetCDF format that MET can read. Currently supports METAR and RAOB
      types of MADIS files with additional MADIS data types to be added in
      future releases.
    - Added new plot_data_plane utility to read any supported gridded data file,
      select a field from that file, and render it as a PostScript image.

- Enhancements to Existing Tools:
    - Distributed latest set of bug fixes for METv3.0.1.
    - Changed the default output directory for the MET statistics tools from
      MET_BASE/out/tool_name to the current directory.
    - Enhanced plot_point_obs by adding a -data_file command line argument to
      specify the grid on which the points should be plotted. Included detailed
      DEBUG(4) information about the points being plotted.
    - Enhanced stat_analysis to enable job command arguments on the command line
      to be used in conjunction with a configuration file. Included detailed
      DEBUG(4) information when deriving wind directions.
    - Enhanced wwmca_regrid and wwmca_plot to specify the pixel age when
      processing the data.
    - Enhanced mode to perform the convolution step more quickly.
    - When using MET statistics tools (like grid_stat, point_stat, wavelet_stat,
      ensemble_stat, and mode) to verify the NetCDF output of other MET tools
      (like pcp_combine and ensemble_stat), added logic to look for the name
      and level NetCDF variable attributes. If present, write those values out
      into the FCST_VAR, OBS_VAR, FCST_LEV or OBS_LEV statistical output
      columns.
    - In the mode_analysis -summary job, modified the computation of the
      standard deviations by dividing by N-1 rather than N which will have a
      slight impact on the output.

- Enhancement to the Build Process:
    - Modified the configuration and build process for MET by grouping the
      parameters that the user needs to edit into a file named user_defs.mk in
      the top-level MET directory.
    - Reorganized the MET directory structure to use src, include, and lib
      sub-directories for the source code, headers, and compiled libraries,
      respectively.

Version 3.0 Release Notes:
-------------------------

- What's New:
    - Initial release of the Ensemble-Stat tool. This tool will read an
      arbitrary number of deterministic forecast files and derive ensemble
      forecasts and statistics. Ensemble mean, spread, and probability are among
      the many fields that can be derived by this tool. Additionally, if
      corresponding observations are included, this tool will produce rank
      histograms, probability integral transform (PIT) values, and the
      continuous ranked probability score (CRPS).
    - Addition of a tools sub-directory for ancillary tools that may not be of
      general interest. These tools are not compiled unless the compilation flag
      is enabled in the top-level Makefile.
    - In the tools sub-directory, initial release of the wwmca_regrid and
      wwmca_plot tools for regridding and plotting the World Wide Merged Cloud
      Analysis (WWMCA) product from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA).
    - In the tools sub-directory, initial release of plot_point_obs tool for
      plotting the locations of point observations in the MET NetCDF point
      observation file format.
    - Enhance MET to support the NetCDF output of the WRF-ARW pinterp tool. When
      reading gridded NetCDF data into the MET tools, users will now have to
      explicitly specify in the configuration file the names and dimensions of
      the NetCDF variables to be read.

- Library Code:
    - Enhance to read the gridded NetCDF output of the WRF-ARW pinterp tool.
    - Enhance to read the gridded NetCDF output of the MET Ensemble-Stat tool.
    - Enhance the NetCDF output of the MET tools to include global attributes
      for the MET version and MET tool used to create it.
    - Enhance the gridded NetCDF output of the MET tools to include variables
      specifying the latitude and longitude of each grid point so the data can
      be displayed using the Integrated Data Viewer (IDV) tool from UCAR-Unidata.
    - Enhance the gridded NetCDF output of the MET tools to include a standard
      set of variable attributes containing timing information.
    - Enhance the parsing of the gridded NetCDF data files to be backwards
      compatible with METv2.0 so that METv3.0 can read the NetCDF output of the
      PCP-Combine tool from METv2.0.

- ASCII2NC and PB2NC Tools:
    - Enhance how accumulation intervals are stored in the NetCDF point
      observation files. Store them as seconds rather than hours to allow for
      sub-hourly accumulation intervals.

- PB2NC Tool:
    - Modify FORTRAN code to remove compiler warnings.
    - Modify logic of the "-dump" command line option to only do an ASCII dump
      for those message types actually requested in the configuration file.

- Gen-Poly-Mask Tool:
    - No changes.

- PCP-Combine Tool:
    - Enhance the error checking of command line arguments.
    - Enhance logic for the "-add" command to allow for an arbitrary number
      (1 or more) of input files to be added together.
    - Enhance to allow for multiple entries for the "-pcp_dir" command line
      argument to specify multiple search directories.
    - Enhance to allow for off-hour accumulation intervals by specifying them in
      HH[MMSS] format. Output NetCDF variables are named in APCP_HH or
      APCP_HHMMSS format.
    - Enhance to allow for off-hour data by specifying timestrings in
      YYYYMMDD[_HH[MMSS]] format.
    - Modify how the "level" NetCDF variable attribute is written to be
      consistent with how the level information is written by the other MET
      tools.

- Point-Stat, Grid-Stat, Wavelet-Stat, and MODE Tools:
    - Add "-fcst_lead", "-fcst_valid", "-obs_lead", and "-obs_valid" command
      line options to explicitly specify which GRIB records to use. These are
      necessary when reading a GRIB file containing multiple output times.
    - Delete trailing spaces from the ASCII output files generated by these
      STAT tools, thus greatly reducing the file size of the output STAT files.
    - Enhance to write out error messages using human-readable time strings
      rather than unixtime.
    - Enhance to more closely check the equality of the input forecast and
      observation grids. Ensure that they are identical, rather than just having
      the same dimensions.

- Point-Stat and Grid-Stat Tools:
    - Enhance to parse NCEP's probability information from the GRIB Product
      Description Section, specifically for the Short-Range Ensemble Forecast
      (SREF) data.
    - In the probabilistic contingency table statistics (PSTD) line type, add
      the base rate as an output column (BASER).
    - In PSTD line type, move the "N_THRESH" output column after "TOTAL" to be
      consistent with the other probabilistic line types.
    - For the output probabilistic lines (PCT, PSTD, PJC, and PRC) in the
      "FCST_THRESH" output column, replace NA with a list of the actual
      probability thresholds used.
    - Add support for the multi-category contingency table counts and
      statistics, MCTC and MCTS output lines, respectively. Multi-category
      contingency tables are computed whenever the output flags for them is
      turned on and the user has specified multiple thresholds to be used.
    - Enhance to only require that users specify thresholds in the configuration
      file when they have selected output line types that actually require them.

- Point-Stat Tool:
    - Enhance to allow for the verification of ranges of vertical levels
      (e.g. TMP/Z30-60), rather than just ranges of pressure levels.
    - If one of the point observation files passed to Point-Stat doesn't exist,
      print a warning message rather than erroring out.
    - Rename command line option from "-ncfile" to "-point_obs" to be consistent
      with the Ensemble-Stat options.
    - Rename command line options from "-valid_beg" and "-valid_end" to
      "-obs_valid_beg" and "-obs_valid_end". Note that previous options do
      still work.
    - Add the station name as an output column (OBS_SID) in the matched pair
      (MPR) output line type.
    - Explicitly state the observation valid time in the "OBS_VALID_BEG" and
      "OBS_VALID_END" columns in the matched pair (MPR) output line type.
    - Add detailed logging information when verbosity is set to 3 or higher.
      For each verification task, dump out counts of reason codes listing why
      observations were not used.
    - Enhance the error checking to error out when the user has specified a
      gridded NetCDF forecast file but has not specified the verifying GRIB
      observations (obs_field) to be used in the configuration file.

- Grid-Stat Tool:
    - Add the "-interp_flag" configuration option to specify which fields
      should be smoothed.
    - Enhance the algorithm for computing fractional coverage for neighborhood
      verification methods, making the code run substantially faster for large
      neighborhood sizes.

- Wavelet-Stat Tool:
    - Enhance to allow the forecast and observation fields to be specified
      separately in the configuration file.

- Stat-Analysis Tool:
    - Add the "-column_eq" job command option for filtering STAT data.
    - Add the "-column_str" job command option to do string comparisons when
      filtering STAT data. This was added to filter on the station names listed
      in the "OBS_SID" column. Users may specify multiple values by providing a
      comma-separated list.
    - Enhance to parse and aggregate the RHIST and ORANK output lines from the
      Ensemble-Stat tool.
    - Enhance to parse and aggregate the MCTC and MCTS output lines from the
      Point-Stat and Grid-Stat tools.
    - Add "-tmp_dir" command line argument and fix bug in how the temporary
      directory is set.
    - Add the "-vif_flag" job command option to enable the computation of the
      variance inflation factor. Enabling the VIF causes the normal confidence
      intervals in the output statistics to be adjusted to account for lag 1
      autocorrelation when accumulating statistics through time.
    - Fix bug to enable Stat-Analysis to accumulate matched pair lines (MPR)
      and compute the MCTC or MCTS output line types.
    - Fix bug so that Stat-Analysis can parse strings like "PROB(TMP<273)" in
      the "FCST_VAR" and "OBS_VAR" columns when reading MPR lines.

- MODE Tool:
    - Shortened the output file naming convention by removing the fcst/obs
      variable/level information. Suggest using the "output_prefix"
      configuration option to customize output file names.

- MODE-Analysis Tool:
    - No changes.

Version 2.0 Release Notes:
-------------------------

- Build process
   - Add sample Makefile for building MET with Intel compilers.

- Library code
   - Restructure and rename output ASCII file format from VSDB to STAT and add
     output columns to store data in a more straight-forward way.
   - Enable more sophisticated masking for the Point-Stat, Grid-Stat, and MODE
     tools by reading the output of the Gen-Poly-Mask tool or any other gridded
     data field and, optionally, thresholding that field to define a masking
     region.

- ASCII2NC
   - Fix bug so that observations values from the same observing location are
     assigned the same header id.

- PB2NC
   - Remove requirement that PrepBufr files be Fortran-blocked prior to running
     through PB2NC.  The blocking is now done internally as specified in the
     ARCH_FLAGS in the top-level MET Makefile.  The "-DBLOCK4" flag indicates
     that 4-byte blocking should be performed instead of the default 8-byte
     blocking.  This is compiler-dependent.  The sample Makefiles contain a
     best guess for each compiler, but if you experience runtime errors from the
     PB2NC tool try adding or removing the "-DBLOCK4" flag, recompiling, and
     rerunning.
   - Running the PB2NC tool, which links to the BUFRLIB library, on 64-bit
     machines continues to be problematic.  Users may continue to build MET and
     the libraries on which it depends as 32-bit on 64-bit machines.  MET users
     will be notified when the BUFRLIB 64-bit issues are resolved.

- Gen-Poly-Mask
   - New for this release.

- PCP-Combine
   - Add the "-ptv" command line argument to specify which GRIB parameter table
     version number should be used.

     selected, thresholded, and compared.  The user can now select them
     independently and compare two different fields.
   - Add the option of specifying a level for a GRIB record as 'L', meaning any
     generic level type, as opposed to specifying a pressure level or vertical
     level.
   - Add support for verifying probabilistic forecasts and add new output line
     types to store the output.  Probabilistic data may have a range of values
     of [0, 1] or [0, 100].  However, probabilistic data with a range of
     [0, 100] will first be rescaled to [0, 1] before verifying it.
   - Add configurable wind speed threshold parameters to specify which (U, V)
     points should be included in the VL1L2 partial sums.
   - Change the "ncep_defaults" configurable parameter to "grib_ptv" to specify
     which GRIB parameter table version number should be used.
   - Add an "output_prefix" configurable parameter to include a user-specified
     string in the output file names.

- Point-Stat
   - Same as Grid-Stat, see above.

- Wavelet-Stat
   - New for this release.

   - Rename the VSDB-Analysis tool to the STAT-Analysis tool and modify it to
     read the STAT output lines from the other MET tools.
   - Simplify names for jobs.
   - Add support for converting VL1L2 STAT lines into information about wind
     direction errors.
   - Add support for reading and aggregating the ISC STAT line from the
     Wavelet-Stat tool.
   - Add support for reading and aggregating the new probability STAT line
     types (PCT, PSTD, PJC, and PRC) from the Grid-Stat and Point-Stat tools.

     which GRIB parameter table version number should be used.
   - Add an "output_prefix" configurable parameter to include a user-specified
     string in the output file names.
   - Modify the output PostScript file to include new summary measures on the
     first page and add a page listing out the pairwise attributes of the
     matched cluster (formerly called "composite") objects.
   - Add a column to the MODE output files for the VERSION number of MODE that
     generated the file.
   - Add a column to the MODE output files for the AREA_THRESH value.

- MODE-Analysis
   - Modify to read the latest MODE output columns.
