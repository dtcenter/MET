Ensemble-Stat Tool
==================

Introduction
____________

The Ensemble-Stat tool may be run to create simple ensemble forecasts (mean, probability, spread, etc) from a set of several forecast model files to be used by the MET statistics tools. If observations are also included, ensemble statistics such as rank histograms, probability integral transform histograms, spread/skill variance, relative position and continuous ranked probability score are produced. Climatological mean and standard deviation data may also be provided, and will be used as a reference forecast in several of the output statistics. Finally, observation error perturbations can be included prior to calculation of statistics. Details about and equations for the statistics produced for ensembles are given in :numref:`Appendix C, Section %s <App_C-ensemble>`.

Scientific and statistical aspects
__________________________________

Ensemble forecasts derived from a set of deterministic ensemble members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensemble forecasts are often created as a set of deterministic forecasts. The ensemble members are rarely used separately. Instead, they can be combined in various ways to produce a forecast. MET can combine the ensemble members into some type of summary forecast according to user specifications. Ensemble means are the most common, and can be paired with the ensemble variance or spread. Maximum, minimum and other summary values are also available, with details in the practical information section.

The ensemble relative frequency is the simplest method for turning a set of deterministic forecasts into something resembling a probability forecast. MET will create the ensemble relative frequency as the proportion of ensemble members forecasting some event. For example, if 5 out of 10 ensemble members predict measurable precipitation at a grid location, then the ensemble relative frequency of precipitation will be :math:`5/10=0.5`. If the ensemble relative frequency is calibrated (unlikely) then this could be thought of as a probability of precipitation.

The neighborhood ensemble probability (NEP) and neighborhood maximum ensemble probability (NMEP) methods are described in :ref:`Schwartz and Sobash (2017) <Schwartz-2017>`. They are an extension of the ensemble relative frequencies described above. The NEP value is computed by averaging the relative frequency of the event within the neighborhood over all ensemble members. The NMEP value is computed as the fraction of ensemble members for which the event is occurring somewhere within the surrounding neighborhood. The NMEP output is typically smoothed using a Gaussian kernel filter. The neighborhood sizes and smoothing options can be customized in the configuration file.

The Ensemble-Stat tool writes the gridded relative frequencies, NEP, and NMEP fields to a NetCDF output file. Probabilistic verification methods can then be applied to those fields by evaluating them with the Grid-Stat and/or Point-Stat tools.

Ensemble statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rank histograms and probability integral transform (PIT) histograms are used to determine if the distribution of ensemble values is the same as the distribution of observed values for any forecast field (:ref:`Hamill, 2001 <Hamill-2001>`). The rank histogram is a tally of the rank of the observed value when placed in order with each of the ensemble values from the same location. If the distributions are identical, then the rank of the observation will be uniformly distributed. In other words, it will fall among the ensemble members randomly in equal likelihood. The PIT histogram applies this same concept, but transforms the actual rank into a probability to facilitate ensembles of differing sizes or with missing members.

Often, the goal of ensemble forecasting is to reproduce the distribution of observations using a set of many forecasts. In other words, the ensemble members represent the set of all possible outcomes. When this is true, the spread of the ensemble is identical to the error in the mean forecast. Though this rarely occurs in practice, the spread / skill relationship is still typically assessed for ensemble forecasts (:ref:`Barker, 1991 <Barker-1991>`; :ref:`Buizza,1997 <Buizza-1997>`). MET calculates the spread and skill in user defined categories according to :ref:`Eckel et al. (2012) <Eckel-2012>`.

The relative position (RELP) is a count of the number of times each ensemble member is closest to the observation. For stochastic or randomly derived ensembles, this statistic is meaningless. For specified ensemble members, however, it can assist users in determining if any ensemble member is performing consistently better or worse than the others.

The ranked probability score (RPS) is included in the Ranked Probability Score (RPS) line type. It is the mean of the Brier scores computed from ensemble probabilities derived for each probability category threshold (prob_cat_thresh) specified in the configuration file. The continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) is the average the distance between the forecast (ensemble) cumulative distribution function and the observation cumulative distribution function. It is an analog of the Brier score, but for continuous forecast and observation fields. The CRPS statistic is computed using two methods: assuming a normal distribution defined by the ensemble mean and spread (:ref:`Gneiting et al., 2004 <Gneiting-2004>`) and using the empirical ensemble distribution (:ref:`Hersbach, 2000 <Hersbach-2000>`). The CRPS statistic is included in the Ensemble Continuous Statistics (ECNT) line type, along with other statistics quantifying the ensemble spread and ensemble mean skill.

Climatology data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Ensemble-Stat output includes at least three statistics computed relative to external climatology data. The climatology is defined by mean and standard deviation fields, and typically both are required in the computation of ensemble skill score statistics. MET assumes that the climatology follows a normal distribution, defined by the mean and standard deviation at each point.

When computing the CRPS skill score for (:ref:`Gneiting et al., 2004 <Gneiting-2004>`) the reference CRPS statistic is computed using the climatological mean and standard deviation directly. When computing the CRPS skill score for (:ref:`Hersbach, 2000 <Hersbach-2000>`) the reference CRPS statistic is computed by selecting equal-area-spaced values from the assumed normal climatological distribution. The number of points selected is determined by the *cdf_bins* setting in the *climo_cdf* dictionary. The reference CRPS is computed empirically from this ensemble of climatology values. If the number bins is set to 1, the climatological CRPS is computed using only the climatological mean value. In this way, the empirical CRPSS may be computed relative to a single model rather than a climatological distribution.

The climatological distribution is also used for the RPSS. The forecast RPS statistic is computed from a probabilistic contingency table in which the probabilities are derived from the ensemble member values. In a simliar fashion, the climatogical probability for each observed value is derived from the climatological distribution. The area of the distribution to the left of the observed value is interpreted as the climatological probability. These climatological probabilities are also evaluated using a probabilistic contingency table from which the reference RPS score is computed. The skill scores are derived by comparing the forecast statistic to the reference climatology statistic.

Ensemble observation error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In an attempt to ameliorate the effect of observation errors on the verification of forecasts, a random perturbation approach has been implemented. A great deal of user flexibility has been built in, but the methods detailed in :ref:`Candille and Talagrand (2008) <Candille-2008>`. can be replicated using the appropriate options. The user selects a distribution for the observation error, along with parameters for that distribution. Rescaling and bias correction can also be specified prior to the perturbation. Random draws from the distribution can then be added to either, or both, of the forecast and observed fields, including ensemble members. Details about the effects of the choices on verification statistics should be considered, with many details provided in the literature (*e.g.* :ref:`Candille and Talagrand, 2008 <Candille-2008>`; :ref:`Saetra et al., 2004 <Saetra-2004>`; :ref:`Santos and Ghelli, 2012 <Santos-2012>`). Generally, perturbation makes verification statistics better when applied to ensemble members, and worse when applied to the observations themselves.

Normal and uniform are common choices for the observation error distribution. The uniform distribution provides the benefit of being bounded on both sides, thus preventing the perturbation from taking on extreme values. Normal is the most common choice for observation error. However, the user should realize that with the very large samples typical in NWP, some large outliers will almost certainly be introduced with the perturbation. For variables that are bounded below by 0, and that may have inconsistent observation errors (e.g. larger errors with larger measurements), a lognormal distribution may be selected. Wind speeds and precipitation measurements are the most common of this type of NWP variable. The lognormal error perturbation prevents measurements of 0 from being perturbed, and applies larger perturbations when measurements are larger. This is often the desired behavior in these cases, but this distribution can also lead to some outliers being introduced in the perturbation step.

Observation errors differ according to instrument, temporal and spatial representation, and variable type. Unfortunately, many observation errors have not been examined or documented in the literature. Those that have usually lack information regarding their distributions and approximate parameters. Instead, a range or typical value of observation error is often reported and these are often used as an estimate of the standard deviation of some distribution. Where possible, it is recommended to use the appropriate type and size of perturbation for the observation to prevent spurious results.

Practical Information
_____________________

This section contains information about configuring and running the Ensemble-Stat tool. The Ensemble-Stat tool creates or verifies gridded model data. For verification, this tool can accept either gridded or point observations. If provided, the climatology data files must be gridded. The input gridded model, observation, and climatology datasets must be on the same grid prior to calculation of any statistics, and in one of the MET supported gridded file formats. If gridded files are not on the same grid, MET will do the regridding for you if you specify the desired output grid. The point observations must be formatted as the NetCDF output of the point reformatting tools described in :numref:`reformat_point`.

ensemble_stat usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The usage statement for the Ensemble Stat tool is shown below:

.. code-block:: none

  Usage: ensemble_stat
         n_ens ens_file_1 ... ens_file_n | ens_file_list
         config_file
         [-grid_obs file]
         [-point_obs file]
         [-ens_mean file]
         [-obs_valid_beg time]
         [-obs_valid_end time]
         [-outdir path]
         [-log file]
         [-v level]
         [-compress level]

ensemble_stat has three required arguments and accepts several optional ones.

Required arguments ensemble_stat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. The **n_ens ens_file_1 ... ens_file_n** is the number of ensemble members followed by a list of ensemble member file names. This argument is not required when ensemble files are specified in the **ens_file_list**, detailed below.

2. The **ens_file_list** is an ASCII file containing a list of ensemble member file names. This is not required when a file list is included on the command line, as described above.

3. The **config_file** is an **EnsembleStatConfig** file containing the desired configuration settings.

Optional arguments for ensemble_stat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

4. To produce ensemble statistics using gridded observations, use the **-grid_obs file** option to specify a gridded observation file. This option may be used multiple times if your observations are in several files.


5. To produce ensemble statistics using point observations, use the **-point_obs file** to specify a NetCDF point observation file. This option may be used multiple times if your observations are in several files.


6. To override the simple ensemble mean value of the input ensemble members for the ECNT, SSVAR, and ORANK line types, the **-ens_mean file** specifies an ensemble mean model data file. This option replaces the **-ssvar_mean file** from earlier versions of MET.

7. To filter point observations by time, use **-obs_valid_beg time** in YYYYMMDD[_HH[MMSS]] format to set the beginning of the matching observation time window.

8. As above, use **-obs_valid_end time** in YYYYMMDD[_HH[MMSS]] format to set the end of the matching observation time window.

9. Specify the **-outdir path** option to override the default output directory (./).

10. The **-log** file outputs log messages to the specified file.

11. The **-v level** option indicates the desired level of verbosity. The value of "level" will override the default setting of 2. Setting the verbosity to 0 will make the tool run with no log messages, while increasing the verbosity will increase the amount of logging.

12. The **-compress level** option indicates the desired level of compression (deflate level) for NetCDF variables. The valid level is between 0 and 9. The value of "level" will override the default setting of 0 from the configuration file or the environment variable MET_NC_COMPRESS. Setting the compression level to 0 will make no compression for the NetCDF output. Lower number is for fast compression and higher number is for better compression.

An example of the ensemble_stat calling sequence is shown below:

.. code-block:: none

     ensemble_stat \
     6 sample_fcst/2009123112/*gep*/d01_2009123112_02400.grib \
     config/EnsembleStatConfig \
     -grid_obs sample_obs/ST4/ST4.2010010112.24h \
     -point_obs out/ascii2nc/precip24_2010010112.nc \
     -outdir out/ensemble_stat -v 2

In this example, the Ensemble-Stat tool will process six forecast files specified in the file list into an ensemble forecast. Observations in both point and grid format will be included, and be used to compute ensemble statistics separately. Ensemble Stat will create a NetCDF file containing requested ensemble fields and an output STAT file.

ensemble_stat configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default configuration file for the Ensemble-Stat tool named **EnsembleStatConfig_default** can be found in the installed *share/met/config* directory. Another version is located in *scripts/config*. We encourage users to make a copy of these files prior to modifying their contents. Each configuration file (both the default and sample) contains many comments describing its contents. The contents of the configuration file are also described in the subsections below.

Note that environment variables may be used when editing configuration files, as described in the :numref:`pb2nc configuration file` for the PB2NC tool.

.. code-block:: none

  ens = {
  ens_thresh = 1.0;
  vld_thresh = 1.0;
  field = [
           {
            name = "APCP";
            level = "A03";
            cat_thresh = [ >0.0, >=5.0 ];
           }
         ];
       }

The **ens** dictionary defines which ensemble fields should be processed.

When summarizing the ensemble, compute a ratio of the number of valid ensemble fields to the total number of ensemble members. If this ratio is less than the **ens_thresh**, then quit with an error. This threshold must be between 0 and 1. Setting this threshold to 1 will require that all ensemble members be present to be processed.


When summarizing the ensemble, for each grid point compute a ratio of the number of valid data values to the number of ensemble members. If that ratio is less than **vld_thresh**, write out bad data. This threshold must be between 0 and 1. Setting this threshold to 1 will require each grid point to contain valid data for all ensemble members.


For each **field** listed in the forecast field, give the name and vertical or accumulation level, plus one or more categorical thresholds. The thresholds are specified using symbols, as shown above. It is the user's responsibility to know the units for each model variable and to choose appropriate threshold values. The thresholds are used to define ensemble relative frequencies, e.g. a threshold of >=5 can be used to compute the proportion of ensemble members predicting precipitation of at least 5mm at each grid point.

  nbrhd_prob = {
     width      = [ 5 ];
     shape      = CIRCLE;
     vld_thresh = 0.0;
  }


The **nbrhd_prob** dictionary defines the neighborhoods used to compute NEP and NMEP output.


The neighborhood **shape** is a **SQUARE** or **CIRCLE** centered on the current point, and the **width** array specifies the width of the square or diameter of the circle as an odd integer. The **vld_thresh** entry is a number between 0 and 1 specifying the required ratio of valid data in the neighborhood for an output value to be computed.


If **ensemble_flag.nep** is set to TRUE, NEP output is created for each combination of the categorical threshold (**cat_thresh**) and neighborhood width specified.

  nmep_smooth = {
     vld_thresh      = 0.0;
     shape           = CIRCLE;

     gaussian_radius = 120;
     type = [
        {
          method = GAUSSIAN;
          width  = 1;
        }
    ];
  }


Similar to the **interp** dictionary, the **nmep_smooth** dictionary includes a **type** array of dictionaries to define one or more methods for smoothing the NMEP data. Setting the interpolation method to nearest neighbor (**NEAREST**) effectively disables this smoothing step.


If **ensemble_flag.nmep** is set to TRUE, NMEP output is created for each combination of the categorical threshold (**cat_thresh**), neighborhood width (**nbrhd_prob.width**), and smoothing method(**nmep_smooth.type**) specified.

_____________________

.. code-block:: none

  obs_thresh = [ NA ];


The **obs_thresh** entry is an array of thresholds for filtering observation values prior to applying ensemble verification logic. The default setting of **NA** means that no observations should be filtered out. Verification output will be computed separately for each threshold specified. This option may be set separately for each **obs.field** entry.

____________________

.. code-block:: none

  skip_const = FALSE;


Setting **skip_const** to true tells Ensemble-Stat to exclude pairs where all the ensemble members and the observation have a constant value. For example, exclude points with zero precipitation amounts from all output line types. This option may be set separately for each **obs.field** entry. When set to false, constant points are and the observation rank is chosen at random.

____________________

.. code-block:: none

  ens_ssvar_bin_size = 1.0;
  ens_phist_bin_size = 0.05;
  prob_cat_thresh    = [];


Setting up the **fcst** and **obs** dictionaries of the configuration file is described in :numref:`config_options`. The following are some special considerations for the Ensemble-Stat tool.


The **ens** and **fcst** dictionaries do not need to include the same fields. Users may specify any number of ensemble fields to be summarized, but generally there are many fewer fields with verifying observations available. The **ens** dictionary specifies the fields to be summarized while the **fcst** dictionary specifies the fields to be verified.


The **obs** dictionary looks very similar to the **fcst** dictionary. If verifying against point observations which are assigned GRIB1 codes, the observation section must be defined following GRIB1 conventions. When verifying GRIB1 forecast data, one can easily copy over the forecast settings to the observation dictionary using **obs = fcst;**. However, when verifying non-GRIB1 forecast data, users will need to specify the **fcst** and **obs** sections separately.


The **ens_ssvar_bin_size** and **ens_phist_bin_size** specify the width of the categorical bins used to accumulate frequencies for spread-skill-variance or probability integral transform statistics, respectively.


The **prob_cat_thresh** entry is an array of thresholds to be applied in the computation of the RPS line type. Since these thresholds can change for each variable, they can be specified separately for each **fcst.field** entry. If left empty but climatological mean and standard deviation data is provided, the **climo_cdf** thresholds will be used instead. If no climatology data is provided, and the RPS output line type is requested, then the **prob_cat_thresh** array must be defined.

  obs_error = {
  flag             = FALSE;
  dist_type        = NONE;
  dist_parm        = [];
  inst_bias_scale  = 1.0;
  inst_bias_offset = 0.0;
  }


The **obs_error** dictionary controls how observation error information should be handled. This dictionary may be set separately for each **obs.field** entry. Observation error information can either be specified directly in the configuration file or by parsing information from an external table file. By default, the **MET_BASE/data/table_files/obs_error_table.txt** file is read but this may be overridden by setting the **$MET_OBS_ERROR_TABLE** environment variable at runtime.


The **flag** entry toggles the observation error logic on (**TRUE**) and off (**FALSE**). When the **flag** is **TRUE**, random observation error perturbations are applied to the ensemble member values. No perturbation is applied to the observation values but the bias scale and offset values, if specified, are applied.


The **dist_type** entry may be set to **NONE, NORMAL, LOGNORMAL, EXPONENTIAL,CHISQUARED, GAMMA, UNIFORM**, or **BETA**. The default value of **NONE** indicates that the observation error table file should be used rather than the configuration file settings.


The **dist_parm** entry is an array of length 1 or 2 specifying the parameters for the distribution selected in **dist_type**. The **GAMMA, UNIFORM**, and **BETA** distributions are defined by two parameters, specified as a comma-separated list (a,b), whereas all other distributions are defined by a single parameter.


The **inst_bias_scale** and **inst_bias_offset** entries specify bias scale and offset values that should be applied to observation values prior to perturbing them. These entries enable bias-correction on the fly.


Defining the observation error information in the configuration file is convenient but limited. The random perturbations for all points in the current verification task are drawn from the same distribution. Specifying an observation error table file instead (by setting **dist_type = NONE;**) provides much finer control, enabling the user to define observation error distribution information and bias-correction logic separately for each observation variable name, message type, PrepBUFR report type, input report type, instrument type, station ID, range of heights, range of pressure levels, and range of values.

  rps   = NONE;
  rhist = NONE;

The **output_flag** array controls the type of output that is generated. Each flag corresponds to an output line type in the STAT file. Setting the flag to NONE indicates that the line type should not be generated. Setting the flag to STAT indicates that the line type should be written to the STAT file only. Setting the flag to BOTH indicates that the line type should be written to the STAT file as well as a separate ASCII file where the data is grouped by line type. The output flags correspond to the following output line types:


1. **ECNT** for Continuous Ensemble Statistics

2. **RPS** for Ranked Probability Score Statistics

3. **RHIST** for Ranked Histogram Counts

4. **PHIST** for Probability Integral Transform Histogram Counts

    nc_var_str = "";


The **nc_var_str** entry specifies a string for each ensemble field and verification task. This string is parsed from each **ens.field** and **obs.field** dictionary entry and is used to customize the variable names written to theNetCDF output file. The default is an empty string, meaning that no customization is applied to the output variable names. When the Ensemble-Stat config file contains two fields with the same name and level value, this entry is used to make the resulting variable names unique.

  rng = {
     type = "mt19937";
     seed = "";
     }


The **rng** group defines the random number generator **type** and **seed** to be used. In the case of a tie when determining the rank of an observation, the rank is randomly chosen from all available possibilities. The randomness is determined by the random number generator specified.


The **seed** variable may be set to a specific value to make the assignment of ranks fully repeatable. When left empty, as shown above, the random number generator seed is chosen automatically which will lead to slightly different bootstrap confidence intervals being computed each time the data is run.


Refer to the description of the **boot** entry in :numref:`config_options` for more details on the random number generator.


ensemble_stat output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ensemble_stat can produce output in STAT, ASCII, and NetCDF formats. The ASCII output duplicates the STAT output but has the data organized by line type. The output files are written to the default output directory or the directory specified by the -outdir command line option.


The output STAT file is named using the following naming convention:


ensemble_stat_PREFIX_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSSV.stat where PREFIX indicates the user-defined output prefix and YYYYMMDD_HHMMSSV indicates the forecast valid time. Note that the forecast lead time is not included in the output file names since it would not be well-defined for time-lagged ensembles. When verifying multiple lead times for the same valid time, users should either write the output to separate directories or specify an output prefix to ensure unique file names.


The output ASCII files are named similarly:


ensemble_stat_PREFIX_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSSV_TYPE.txt where TYPE is one of ecnt, rps, rhist, phist, relp, orank, and ssvar to indicate the line type it contains.


When fields are requested in the ens dictionary of the configuration file or verification against gridded fields is performed, ensemble_stat can produce output NetCDF files using the following naming convention:


ensemble_stat_PREFIX_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSSV_TYPE.nc where TYPE is either ens or orank. The orank NetCDF output file contains gridded fields of observation ranks when the -grid_obs command line option is used. The ens NetCDF output file contains ensemble products derived from the fields requested in the ens dictionary of the configuration file. The Ensemble-Stat tool can calculate any of the following fields from the input ensemble members, as specified in the ensemble_flag dictionary in the configuration file:


Ensemble Mean fields


Ensemble Standard Deviation fields


Ensemble Mean - 1 Standard Deviation fields


Ensemble Mean + 1 Standard Deviation fields


Ensemble Minimum fields


Ensemble Maximum fields


Ensemble Range fields


Ensemble Valid Data Count fields


Ensemble Relative Frequency by threshold fields (e.g. ensemble probabilities)


Neighborhood Ensemble Probability and Neighborhood Maximum Ensemble Probability


Rank for each Observation Value (if gridded observation field provided)


When gridded or point observations are provided, using the -grid_obs and -point_obs command line options, respectively, the Ensemble-Stat tool can compute the following statistics for the fields specified in the fcst and obs dictionaries of the configuration file:


Continuous Ensemble Statistics


Ranked Histograms


Probability Integral Transform (PIT) Histograms


Relative Position Histograms


Spread/Skill Variance


Ensemble Matched Pair information


The format of the STAT and ASCII output of the Ensemble-Stat tool are described below.
