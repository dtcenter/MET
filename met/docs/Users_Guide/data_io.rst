MET Data I/O
============

Data must often be preprocessed prior to using it for verification. Several MET tools exist for this purpose. In addition to preprocessing observations, some plotting utilities for data checking are also provided and described at the end of this section. Both the input and output file formats are described in this section. :numref:`Input data formats` and :numref:`Intermediate data formats` are primarily concerned with re-formatting input files into the intermediate files required by some MET modules. These steps are represented by the first three columns in the MET flowchart depicted in :numref:`overview-figure`. Output data formats are described in :numref:`Output data formats`. Common configuration files options are described in :numref:`Configuration File Details`. Description of software modules used to reformat the data may now be found in :numref:`reformat_point`  and :numref:`reformat_grid`.

Input data formats
__________________

The MET package can handle multiple gridded input data formats: GRIB version 1, GRIB version 2, and NetCDF files following the Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions, containing WRF output post-processed using wrf_interp, or produced by the MET tools themselves. MET supports standard NCEP, USAF, UKMet Office and ECMWF GRIB tables along with custom, user-defined GRIB tables and the extended PDS including ensemble member metadata. See :numref:`Configuration File Details` for more information. Point observation files may be supplied in either PrepBUFR, ASCII, or MADIS format. Note that MET does not require the Unified Post-Processor to be used, but does require that the input GRIB data be on a standard, de-staggered grid on pressure or regular levels in the vertical. While the Grid-Stat, Wavelet-Stat, MODE, and MTD tools can be run on a gridded field at virtually any level, the Point-Stat tool can only be used to verify forecasts at the surface or on pressure or height levels. MET does not interpolate between native model vertical levels.

When comparing two gridded fields with the Grid-Stat, Wavelet-Stat, Ensemble-Stat, MODE, MTD, or Series-Analysis tools, the input model and observation datasets must be on the same grid. MET will regrid files according to user specified options. Alternatively, outside of MET, the copygb and wgrib2 utilities are recommended for re-gridding GRIB1 and GRIB2 files, respectively. To preserve characteristics of the observations, it is generally preferred to re-grid the model data to the observation grid, rather than vice versa.

Input point observation files in PrepBUFR format are available through NCEP. The PrepBUFR observation files contain a wide variety of point-based observation types in a single file in a standard format. However, some users may wish to use observations not included in the standard PrepBUFR files. For this reason, prior to performing the verification step in the Point-Stat tool, the PrepBUFR file is reformatted with the PB2NC tool. In this step, the user can select various ways of stratifying the observation data spatially, temporally, and by type. The remaining observations are reformatted into an intermediate NetCDF file. The ASCII2NC tool may be used to convert ASCII point observations that are not available in the PrepBUFR files into this common NetCDF point observation format. Several other MET tools, described below, are also provided to reformat point observations into this common NetCDF point observation format prior to passing them as input to the Point-Stat or Ensemble-Stat verification tools.

Tropical cyclone forecasts and observations are typically provided in a specific ATCF (Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting) ASCII format, in A-deck, B-deck, and E-deck files.

.. _Intermediate data formats:

Intermediate data formats
_________________________

MET uses NetCDF as an intermediate file format. The MET tools which write gridded output files write to a common gridded NetCDF file format. The MET tools which write point output files write to a common point observation NetCDF file format.

.. _Output data formats:

Output data formats
___________________

The MET package currently produces output in the following basic file formats: STAT files, ASCII files, NetCDF files, PostScript plots, and png plots from the Plot-Mode-Field utility.

The STAT format consists of tabular ASCII data that can be easily read by many analysis tools and software packages. MET produces STAT output for the Grid-Stat, Point-Stat, Ensemble-Stat, Wavelet-Stat, and TC-Gen tools. STAT is a specialized ASCII format containing one record on each line. However, a single STAT file will typically contain multiple line types. Several header columns at the beginning of each line remain the same for each line type. However, the remaining columns after the header change for each line type. STAT files can be difficult for a human to read as the quantities represented for many columns of data change from line to line.

For this reason, ASCII output is also available as an alternative for these tools. The ASCII files contain exactly the same output as the STAT files but each STAT line type is grouped into a single ASCII file with a column header row making the output more human-readable. The configuration files control which line types are output and whether or not the optional ASCII files are generated.

The MODE tool creates two ASCII output files as well (although they are not in a STAT format). It generates an ASCII file containing contingency table counts and statistics comparing the model and observation fields being compared. The MODE tool also generates a second ASCII file containing all of the attributes for the single objects and pairs of objects. Each line in this file contains the same number of columns, and those columns not applicable to a given line type contain fill data. Similarly, the MTD tool writes one ASCII output file for 2D objects attributes and four ASCII output files for 3D object attributes.

The TC-Pairs and TC-Stat utilities produce ASCII output, similar in style to the STAT files, but with TC relevant fields.

Many of the tools generate gridded NetCDF output. Generally, this output acts as input to other MET tools or plotting programs. The point observation preprocessing tools produce NetCDF output as input to the statistics tools. Full details of the contents of the NetCDF files is found in :numref:`Data format summary` below.

The MODE, Wavelet-Stat and plotting tools produce PostScript plots summarizing the spatial approach used in the verification. The PostScript plots are generated using internal libraries and do not depend on an external plotting package. The MODE plots contain several summary pages at the beginning, but the total number of pages will depend on the merging options chosen. Additional pages will be created if merging is performed using the double thresholding or fuzzy engine merging techniques for the forecast and observation fields. The number of pages in the Wavelet-Stat plots depend on the number of masking tiles used and the dimension of those tiles. The first summary page is followed by plots for the wavelet decomposition of the forecast and observation fields. The generation of these PostScript output files can be disabled using command line options.

Users can use the optional plotting utilities Plot-Data-Plane, Plot-Point-Obs, and Plot-Mode-Field to produce graphics showing forecast, observation, and MODE object files.

Configuration File Details
__________________________

Part of the strength of MET is the leveraging of capability across tools. There are several configuration options that are common to many of the tools.

Many of the MET tools use a configuration file to set parameters. This prevents the command line from becoming too long and cumbersome and makes the output easier to duplicate.


The configuration file details are described in :ref:`config_options` and :ref:`config_options_tc`.
